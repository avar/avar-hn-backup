I don't agree with the current state of copyright, but I think pointing out
that every one of these people are dead is a nonsensical argument. The question
is what incentives should we give people to create creative works, and what
should the cost to society be?

If you're a smart guy with Robert Heinlein and copyright is more limited to a
few years would you ever have written Starship Troopers? Or would you have gone
into something like the real estate business which can last generations and
keep your children and grandchildren happy & fed after you're long dead?

Would the 1998 Starship Troopers movie have been released based on the 1959
book if copyright had been at its original 14 years?

How about a lot of the "cult classic" works of today that only became really
popular and earned money tens of years after their original release?

I don't know what the right answer is, but it's a fallacy to assume that we'd
have the same state of affairs if the incentives we can gave people to create
creative works automatically expired after their death.
