You seem to be assuming that there needs to be a distinctive backend codebase
for each domain covering the wildcard certificate.

This is something entirely orthogonal to the number of certificates. You could
have 1000 codebases with different attack vectors under one SSL certificate, or
1 codebase the same attack vectors serving up 1000 SSL certificates.
