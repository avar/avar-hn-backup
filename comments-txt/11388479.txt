One of the relatively cryptic parts of the release notes is:

    * Update the untracked cache subsystem and change its primary UI from
      "git update-index" to "git config".

This is a feature we worked on, it means that you can do this:

    $ sudo git config --system core.untrackedCache true

And have [core] untrackedCache = true written to /etc/gitconfig. This'll speed
up "git status" and similar index operations significantly.

I've seen "git status" times go from ~400ms to ~200ms and from ~140ms to ~60ms
simply by setting this.

It could be set via "git update-index" in previous Git versions on a per-repo
basis, but not on a system-wide basis, this makes it easier to e.g. puppetize
it.
