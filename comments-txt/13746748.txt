There is! One thing it's highly correlated with is whether you're either a
heterosexual woman, or a homosexual man.

There's a really good description of this and other brain attributes correlated
with gender or male homosexuality in the BBC show "The Making of Me - John
Barrowman". This specific part starts around 6m30s in: http://

Here's an article about it in New Scientist, "Gay men read maps like women":

That's not to suggest that you're either a homosexual man or a heterosexual
woman based on this datapoint alone. There's of course plenty of people who
don't fall into those groups who prefer to read maps that way, just to answer
your question about whether there's research about it. Yeah, there's at least
some research showing that spatial recognition is indicative of gender & sexual
orientation.
