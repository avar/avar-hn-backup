You're right about the issues, I wish GitHub used some plain-text format with
an optional UI for that (e.g. plain org-mode files), but the wiki on GitHub is
just a plain Git repo with Markdown files, it's not centralized.

I don't see how you lose the community more than with any hosting method. If
GitHub were nuked off the face of the earth you have all the contributors in
your Git history, just send them a mail with the new location of the repo.
