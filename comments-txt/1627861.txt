I sometimes use --amend, but it's good to get yourself into the habit of just
making a new commit, then squashing it with git rebase -i.

I use magit.el for Emacs which makes this really easy, and if you screw up
getting your data back from the reflog is a lot easier than if you just had a
bunch of --amend fixups.
