Nobody's attributing deaths to single causes. When we say e.g. that coal plants
kill N number of people per year it's not the case that someone breathed in
some coal particulates and keeled over night there at the age of 20.

Rather, we know from epidemiological data that certain pollution, foods etc.
shorten your life by a given amount. Let's say life expectancy is 100 years,
living near a coal plant subtracts 5 years from that, and living near a nuclear
plant 0. That would mean that out of 20 people living there there was 1 death
equivalent a year.
