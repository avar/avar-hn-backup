Greenland didn't become uninhabitable during the little ice age, there's people
living now in Greenland descended from people who survived that supposedly
uninhabitable country.

The Norse colony got wiped out, but it's unknown whether that was because of
war, famine or some other reason. We just know life would have been hardier in
those years.

What little we do know suggests that they were unwilling to learn the
traditional lifestyle from the natives, and the country became uninhabitable
for anyone insisting on only using Norse farming methods.
