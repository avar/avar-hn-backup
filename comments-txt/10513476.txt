No, they're patenting the organism, or the end result. If you come up with an
entirely different process to tweak the same organism by happenstance it's
still covered by the patent.

This is pretty much the definition of how patents differ from copyright law, if
I word-for-word write come up with the same work as you and I can prove that I
didn't copy yours, it's not covered by copyright law.

With patents it doesn't matter that I came up with it on my own, you own the
rights to the end result.
