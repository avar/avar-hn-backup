As an Amsterdam resident: What a romantic characterization of our high crime
rates! Yes, the reason I still ride a shitty old beater of a bike is definitely
my long lasting love for that piece of shit, it's not because I know that if I
buy anything fancy I'm going to have to never take my eyes off of it, least it
be stolen in under half a minute in certain parts of town[1].
