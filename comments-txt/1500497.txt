The Windows compilers are more capable than old 90s compilers. But random
source code written for Linux is a lot more compatible as-is with AIX, HP-UX,
IRIX and others than with Windows.

Windows doesn't have forks (needs emulation via threads), second class support
for things like symlinks, and isn't POSIX compatible (yes, I know you can get
that as a separate install).

Porting a Linux program to Windows is like porting it to Novell, or some random
mainfram OS. Not another OS in the Unix family.
