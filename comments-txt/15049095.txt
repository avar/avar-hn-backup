Why not force companies to standardize the size and shape of the concrete
counterweight, and mandate that it must be easily removable and you can't sell
them bundled with the machines themselves?

Then you could simply remove it for transport, and it many cases reuse the one
from your old machine, or buy a really cheap second-hand counterweight from
your local hardware store.
