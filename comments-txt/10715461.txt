We've eclipsed the usefulness of this birdhouse analogy, but suffice to say
being able to replace one proprietary commercial vendor with another doesn't
make something open source.

Well, pragmatically, if you needed to alter the hardware of this "open source"
hardware what percentage of the total electronic complexity would you be
working with? I'm going to aim for a conservative one-digit percentile.

There's a real and unambiguous line to be drawn in the sand here. If you get
"open source" plans for hardware that you can't replicate with third-party
fabrication & your own materials it's not open source. It's just a recipe for
assembling commercial proprietary components.

It's awesome that people publish those recipes, but don't call it open source
hardware and dilute the meaning of hardware that is genuinely open.
