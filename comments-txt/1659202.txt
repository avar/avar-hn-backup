Why specifically can't you believe that it evolves. And what do you have to
back up the assertion that "natural selection does not work like that", when
all the evidence and consequently the consensus of the scientific community is
that it does.

The idea you're advocating has a name, "Irreducible complexity"[1], and has
been debunked time and time again as pseudoscience. I won't go into debunking
specific assertions you made (such as the impossibility of the evolution of
lungs), but I really encourage you to read the current literature of
evolutionary theory. Once you see the mountain of evidence for it you'll
probably be convinced.
