It's advertised as a comedy show and with Seth MacFarlane (of Family Guy)
headlining it I also assumed it was some cheap Galaxy Quest-esque jab at Star
Trek. There's some of that, in particular taking some jabs at Star Trek tropes
(e.g. one situation being neatly resolved by the crew using seatbelts)[1].

But it's not just some cheap comedy. Yes there's campy humor that's basically
the equivalent of TOS not taking itself quite seriously, but it's in every
other way a proper modern day sequel to TNG, and the humor doesn't get in the
way of that.

I'm not going to spoil the 3rd episode of it that just came out, but it's a
"moral conundrum" episode of the likes TNG was famous for, except it's IMNSHO
executed better than any such TNG episode. Those tended to get resolved with
some Deus Ex Machina or something resembling a stereotypically happy American
ending, but The Orville took the hard way out. I was very impressed.

1. For those unfamiliar with Star Trek: Approximately half of on-screen
fatalities could be prevented by some combination of seatbelt usage, and the
computer consoles not being powered by 100,000 volts of electricity with no
fuses or circuit breakers[2].

2. The other half being prevented by not bringing no-name red shirts along on
the away mission.
