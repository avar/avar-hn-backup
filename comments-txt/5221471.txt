It's unclear from this whether or not Python would have to change the name of
the programming language if they didn't get the trademark, or whether this UK
company would just have the right to call their products "Python" too.

Early in the article it says: "There is a company in the UK that is trying to
trademark the use of the term "Python" for all software, services, servers...
pretty much anything having to do with a computer.".

And later it says, where the Python foundation is soliciting comments: "your
view that another company using term Python to refer to services, software, and
servers would be confusing".

I for one hope the Python foundation doesn't get an exclusive trademark for all
"software, services, servers" in the E.U. Outside of software "Python" is a
well-known generic name for an animal, I don't think the EU should be
protecting such generic names.

But on the other hand it would also suck if this U.K. company gained exclusive
use over the trademark.
