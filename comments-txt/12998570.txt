My impression (as a European) of the US system is that in practice what we have
with individual states here in Europe + EU isn't possible in the US, since the
federal government taxes are proportionally so high, compared to what
individual EU members contribute to the EU.

Thus while individual states could implement their own health care system, it
would have to be on top of everything that's federally mandated, which they're
already paying for. The tax burden would be outrageous, so it just doesn't
happen.

It's also odd to see other Europeans dismiss the argument many Americans have
for a smaller federal government, while in practice that's pretty much what we
have over here in the EU. Could you imagine a EU-wide single-payer health care
system? It would be a complete disaster.

So in that sense I wonder if the better solution for the EU would be to roll
back all federal health entitlements (Medicare etc.) and just implement this
completely on the state levels, then states like California and the like could
have European-like single-payer health care systems, while perhaps other states
would opt for different systems.
