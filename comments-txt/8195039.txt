What's the endgame for propping up population numbers with immigration? Surely
the whole system falls apart once the net fertility rate falls below 2. What
then?

There's good reasons to be immigration-friendly, but dealing with the endgame
of the inevitably shrinking population like the Japanese are doing seems like a
better long-term strategy than the temporary band-aid solution of solving the
problem in the short-term with increased immigration.
