You definitely can't consider them metric tons. If the bridge you're about to
cross has a maximum advertised load of 120 sh tn and you consider it safe to
drive your 120 m tn vehicle over the bridge on the basis of that you're going
to be putting a 132.3 m tn load on the bridge, or roughly 10% more than it's
rated for.
