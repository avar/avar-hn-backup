Yeah, and a system like that could be worse in some ways. Likely what would
happen is that what are currently the CA's would be the highest trusted parties
in the system, and that trust would largely be derived from them trusting each
other.

This is largely a matter of the game theory dynamics behind this, but if one of
them does something bad are the other parties more or less likely to revoke
trust? If they easily revoke trust they're creating a dynamic where if they
mess up in "minor" ways their whole business could get destroyed. The penalty
for not revoking trust soon enough might be much too small to create a system
better than what we have now.

I don't know, and I wonder if there's been any research on the various aspects
of replacing the CA system with a trust-based system.
