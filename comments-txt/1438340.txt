Perhaps you missed the part where I indicated that they were better than the
previous government. They're just still a disappointment.

It's not like I'm some bitter right winger either, my views align more closely
with theirs in theory. But in practice they're about the worst thing that could
have happened after the crisis, sans the incumbents.

They've failed to enact any meaningful change to financial regulation or
government oversight since they took power. They've failed to implement the
government transparency that was widely demanded of them (e.g. doing secretive
dealings with the IMF). The issue of changing the constitution is now dead in
some committee.

As an example of something that's (still) being done right check out the
election of the Best Party in Reykjav√≠k. Their agenda (here in Icelandic: http:
//www.bestiflokkurinn.is/ur-starfi-flokksins/samstarfsy...) includes things
that are actually relevant to improving short- and long term life for the
population. They've set up an instance of a "shadow government" at http://
betrireykjavik.is (running http://github.com/rbjarnason/open-direct-democracy),
a fair amount of their policies are being drawn from there. So they're actually
listening to their constituency.
