I have no idea what's true in this, but I've heard exactly the opposite
economic theories about WWII as it pertains to the US.

I.e. that untold amounts of capital was spent on making equipment that was just
sent overseas to get blown up, if the US wasn't in the war it's not like it
wouldn't have had a giant export market, and all that workforce could still be
mobilized to manufacture goods, except some of the working-age people wouldn't
have been sent overseas to die & get maimed.
