I'm not in the U.S. so I can't spend a few bucks on Netflix. But your bad
experience with BitTorrent is probably purely a function of using the wrong
trackers.

I have access to some trackers where the download very rarely goes below 2MB/s,
with 5-8MB/s being the average. Some of these have material like discontinued
music and foreign films that I could never get where I live, at least not
without significant hassle.

With this setup I can initiate a download for a foreign 720p film, go and make
some tea, and it'll be there by the time I come back.

That's quality of service I can't even pay for where I live, no matter how much
cash I fork out.
