Very interesting. I didn't know about that, or that as their FAQ[1] indicates
that local city law can override general Dutch traffic law. I.e. instead of
priority to the right applying to these intersections[2] nobody has priority.

Seems confusing, especially as their FAQ stipulates the same intersection will
revert back to priority to the right at night when the yellow lights are
blinking, but admittedly "priority to the guyw ho wins the game of chicken" is
the way it works in the rest of the Netherlands anyway.

2. Per RVV 1990[3] article 15: "Op kruispunten verlenen bestuurders voorrang
aan voor hen van rechts komende bestuurders".

4. Yes my footnotes now have footnotes.
