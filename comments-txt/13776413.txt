You don't have to know what would be a mistake. E.g. if the tool is used most
of the time to operate on a small set of servers, you have some extra
confirmation or command-line option for removing a large set.

That's good UI design in tools with powerful destructive capabilities. You make
the UI to do lots of things v.s. the few things you do routinely different
enough that there's no mistaking them.
