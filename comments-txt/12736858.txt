As someone who works at another company with a big monorepo, briefly:

* Ability to change an API and all its users at the same time.

* Circular dependencies become a non-issue in a lot of cases where the would be
if you vendor your dependencies.

* Even if you vendor your dependencies hunting for bugs is a lot easier, your
bisect of a bug in a library will just come down the commit that upgraded it
from 1.0 to 2.0 without a monorepo, with a monorepo you can bisect anything
down to a specific commit.

* Code discoverability / mass edits are a lot easier, and integrate seamlessly
into a lot more tools than if you need to manage multiple checkouts etc.
