Some of the issues they cite ("doesn't currently handle HTTP authentication as
well as it might", "no support for HTTP/1.1") look like they could be solved by
using a HTTP library like libcurl instead of rolling their own thing. I wonder
if there's political opposition to that (since cURL isn't GNU).
