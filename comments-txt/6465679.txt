I used to be very personally excited about this too, but realistically I can't
see habitation on Mars becoming anything more than the equivalent of a
glorified trailer park in Antarctica within my lifetime, except with little
chance of return, and I'm not even 30 yet.

Exciting for humanity, yes! A nice place to go live? Probably not for another
100 years or so. I'm interested in why you'd be so keen to move there.
