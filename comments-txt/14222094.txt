I use OfflineIMAP to fetch & emacs/mu+mu4e+exim to read+index/search+send my
E-Mail. It works, and overall I'm happy with it.

I used to use mbsync but when my employer migrated from Cyrus to Exchange IMAP
I couldn't get mbsync to work with it, but OfflineIMAP worked just fine.

Now they've migrated to GMail, which works fine with both, and even though
OfflineIMAP is more flexible & easier to customize I'll probably switch back at
some point.

OfflineIMAP regularly pegs my CPU at >100% just downloading a few dozen
E-Mails, whereas mbsync's CPU usage never went above 2-3%. When my laptop fan
starts spinning it's usually OfflineIMAP in the background.

So if you're looking for an IMAP->Maildir retriever or backup solution consider
trying out mbsync first.

It's a PAIN to switch between these programs, or even using the same data when
switching between different servers (e.g. Cyrus -> Exchange). Inexplicably
neither of them have some sort of reindexing mode where they can take an
existing Maildir and reconstruct their local database from local/remote
Message-Id's. They both use & maintain an opaque local database. That's why I
haven't simply gone back to mbsync.
