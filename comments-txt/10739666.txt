They'd have to block the entirety of Wikipedia since it uses https. It would be
interesting to see what would happen with these sorts of issues if push came to
shove.

Usually the resort has been that local countries have threatened local editors
living in those countries, e.g. there was a famous case with the French
government threatening someone living in France who was writing about French
nuclear communication outposts on the French Wikipedia (published in the U.S.).
