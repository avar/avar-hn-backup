I think you're being overly generous in ascribing the intentions of an entire
company on this.

Most likely the real reason behind this is that some programmer in their employ
who didn't know better hammered in "bogusapple.com" as the first thing he could
come up with, committed it since it worked for him, and now a lot of people are
trying to ascribe more complex intentions to Apple than that.
