The mirroring they were using is explicitly meant to be a fast local ad-hoc
clone that doesn't do integrity checks.

They used the safe version before, because they were running into problems with
the integrity checks, i.e. ref deletions and non-fast-forwards.

What they should have done was to write a hook or a script that did those
non-safe updates manually (maybe only for some repositories, and some refs,
don't want to rewind e.g. master).

But instead they completely bypassed the safety mechanisms and got screwed by
corruption.
