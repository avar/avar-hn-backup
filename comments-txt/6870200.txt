That doesn't need to be the case. You can have a weighted web of trust where if
a new party (e.g. because they presented their passport & proof of ownership of
a domain) gets trusted because they were certified by an already trusted party.

You could implement a weighted trust system where you're more trusted the more
people trust you, and consequently if you "issue" trust it's counted as more
trustworthy than issuing trust to yourself.

So you could have the equivalent of CA's in a system like that, but the list
could be dynamic based on total trust on the network, instead of being issued
by a static list of 100% trusted parties like the system we have now.
