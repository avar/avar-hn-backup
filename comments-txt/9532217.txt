It's important to realize that when the government makes these sort of comments
their intent is usually to enforce it on a per-company basis.

According to Wikipedia the average size of a board is 9.2 members, and as low
as 3 members[1]. It's easy to imagine a company where the 3 most competent
people all happen to be either male or female.
