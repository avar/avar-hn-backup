There's a very large difference between stated goals and desired goals, the
goals you mentioned are all stated goals.

If you tried to abolish intellectual property the main opposition wouldn't be
parties whose main motivation would be a genuine concern that you'd be
de-incentivizing invention for the benefit of society, but rather parties who
have a vested interest in the current system for their own benefit.
