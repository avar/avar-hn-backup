Start by picking GMOs instead of the woo-woo that is organic farming. See e.g.
a German-funded meta-analysis[1] that found that:

"[...] the adoption of herbicide-tolerant (HT) soybean, maize, and cotton, and
insect-resistant (IR) maize and cotton has resulted in a 22% increase in
average yields, a 37% overall decrease in pesticide use, and a 68% increase in
farmer profits.".
