No, that's one of its advantages. It's pretty much impossible to "cut" it.

This is what a cannabis bud looks like: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/

You can't just throw some similarly looking vegetation in there without the
buyer noticing. You could throw in low-grade hemp, but that's just as hard to
grow, so it's of no benefit to the dealer.

One thing you can do is to not dry it. The moisture will add a bit of weight,
but probably not more than 5-10% more, depending.
