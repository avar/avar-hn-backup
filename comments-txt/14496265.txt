I just set up a recurring donation for what I think is fair given my (very
small) use of GPG.

I can't help but cynically wonder how much funding GPG would get just from the
various journalists in this donation video making a decent salary who claim
that GPG is indispensable for their work.

Another case of free software tragedy of the commons.
