> This is why your bank doesn't let you make withdrawals from your account on
port 80.

It doesn't matter that my bank doesn't allow withdrawals on port 80 as long as
a MitM allows that, and you can't guard against that unless you train users to
expect CA-signed SSL sites for things like that.

I've already read that and replied to it at: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?

> The HTTP connection isn't lying to you about how secure it is.

A non-CA HTTPS connection isn't lying to me, it's purely a matter of
implementation how you treat that sort of thing. You seem to think that
certification and encryption are inseparable, they aren't.

You can have SSL encryption presuming that you're talking to a known-good
party, while also having the ability to initiate connections to CA-signed
parties.

Yes, but there's no need for it. Browers can decide how they present SSL, if
they consistently present a big "You're secure" banner when talking to CA+SSL
sites and users get used to that when transferring money they'll spot that
something's up when it's missing.
