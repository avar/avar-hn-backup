Yes, I use the SQLite driver, and use & regularly pull the latest version from
the git, 7.1 right now.

I haven't dug into why it uses that CPU in any detail. Looking at its output /
tcpdump of what it's doing it goes to >100% CPU for 10-30 seconds when it's
finished fetching the status from the remote & is presumably in some tight
inner loop comparing it with local data to decide what to do before it starts
downloading messages, and then briefly spends a few more seconds at >100% after
the messages are downloaded, presumably updating its local state.

When it's just issuing IMAP commands or downloading messages from the remote it
sits at 1-5% CPU.

As I pointed out OfflineIMAP works just fine for me, but in retrospect I'd be
happier if I had stayed with mbsync. I don't need any feature from OfflineIMAP
that it doesn't have, and it both uses less CPU/Memory & it finishes deciding
what to download & downloading it in way less time.
