That's an incomplete analogy. Specific Open Source projects aren't democracies
Open Source at large is, or something resembling it.

I installed Ubuntu 10.04 beta1 and didn't like the button arrangement. It was
trivial to fix it by just doing: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:stownsend42/
light-themes

If enough people don't like the default setup of Ubuntu someone will just fork
it. In fact there are already three forks that I know of: Kubuntu, Xubuntu and
Edubuntu.
