Yes it is science illiteracy. It's being blind to a much larger diffuse harm in
the face of some concentrated but much smaller harm.

It's arguably the most harmful kind of science illiteracy because it has the
biggest impact on public policy. Everything from people opposing mandatory seat
belt laws, to being overly concerned about e.g. genetically modified food or
cell phone tower radiation.

I'm sure you mean well, but really, people who hold exactly the opinion you
hold are in the aggregate the reason for literally millions of deaths that
didn't need to happen worldwide since WWII.

We had all the data to indicate that burning fossil fuels was causing massive
diffuse harm, nuclear was realistically the only alternative in most cases, but
people didn't go for it because they were afraid, even though all the science
showed that there was little to worry about in comparison to what we were
already doing.

Sure someone installed a reactor backwards, but how are minor incidents like
these at all relevant compared to literally tens to hundreds of thousands of
deaths per year because we keep using the alternative?
