If it's not, and the governments that make up the EU and its citizens don't
agree, they can change the law can't they?

It's an absurd situation that the law explicitly allows something that's
continually covered in the press as immoral, and to have governments complain
about the status quo through the press, instead of changing the law which is
what they're empowered to do.

So yeah, I hope everyone does the equivalent of registering in in Luxemburg,
because that'll force a resolution to the issue. Either we say that's OK and
that becomes the new norm, or we fix the tax code.
