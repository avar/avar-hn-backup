There's no way that a tidal plant running for 100 years is going to change the
day by 1 second. You're many orders of magnitudes off.

That means that if you built 100 of those plants that in 1 year you'd change
the length of the day by 1 second.

The 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami released 3.9×10^22 joules of energy[1]
and changed the day by just over a microsecond[2]. A single Tsar Bomba releases
2.1×10^17 joules, so you'd need the energy of around 200 thousand of those to
produce the same amount of energy as the earthquake, and then assuming you can
direct that energy you need 1000 times more to shift the day by a second
instead of a microsecond.

That means that each one of your proposed tidal plants would need to generate
the energy of 20,000,000 Tsar Bombas per year.

That's one Tsar Bomba's worth of energy being released every 1.5 seconds at
each one of those 100 plants. Buy stock in sunscreen companies now!

Each one of your 100 plants would satisfy all of current yearly world energy
production in just 30 minutes[3][4].

I'm too lazy to calculate what that would do to the surrounding area, but I'd
wager that they're going to severely depress local property prices due much of
the surrounding beach-side property area now being turned into permanent molten
lava.

The good news is you could probably build really good wind power plants now,
due to constant hurricane winds not seen on Earth since the K–T impact, but I
digress.

I didn't check your molten rock calculation but given how off your tidal plant
calculation is I wouldn't be surprised if it's way off as well.
