The libertarian and anti-government sentiments aren't saying that we shouldn't
be all in this together, but that we shouldn't be forced to be all in this
together. That difference is what the entire argument is about.

Few people are saying saying "let's not do this" for some value of "this",
they're saying "let's not force everyone to do this".

That's a very profound difference, it's why having the government make anything
its business anywhere in the world is always controversial.
