The article only briefly touches on this, but LG Korea is a huge part of this.
They make the motor, battery & drivetrain, basically everything that makes this
car an electric car. Chevrolet is just manufacturing the parts that would be
mostly identical to any of their other cars.

Rather than Tesla being worried about Chevrolet, I think they'd be more worried
about the likes of LG & Samsung in the longer term.
