On second look, yes that Guardian source is pretty shitty. I couldn't find some
authoritative source for the CO^2 emissions required to produce a new car. My
point was that you had to consider it.

It's not meaningful to consider how often they're replaced, but what mileage
they tend to get if we're going to look at how the CO^2 cost of producing the
car is amortized over its lifetime.

According to EPA statistics a typical car gets used for 100-200K miles[1], for
taxis that number seems to be easily 2x or 3x larger[2]. So for the same amount
of moving people from A to B taxis are mor CO^2 efficient.

Of course there are all sorts of secondary effects you're not taking into
account. Once people don't own a car because they have something like Uber
available to them, they're more likely to use a bike or public transport for a
trip they'd otherwise take by car. Just compare somewhere like NYC to LA in
terms of how much CO^2 a typical person emits while going about their day.

I don't know what the exact numbers are, but this is a lot more complex than
what you're making it out to be.
