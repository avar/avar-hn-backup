Don't get me wrong. I'm disappointed in Oculus too, and I'd be even more
disappointed if I'd actually invested in them.

I'm just saying that people need to learn the hard lesson that when they're
"investing" in something like Kickstarter they're not actually "investing" in
the general sense. They're making a donation with little or no string attached,
at best it's a "you give us money and we send you some doodad in the mail"
investment.

So they're effectively donating money with no string attached.

So if you donated money to the company thinking they were going to do X and
they actually do Y they can and will fuck you over if they think they can make
more money doing Y than they can doing X, accounting for all the alienation
from their existing customers from doing not doing X.

So please everyone, if you want to invest in something and you want to have the
expectations of an investor make sure you're actually investing, not just
donating.
