I suppose it doesn't matter much in practice because few things have the
density of an engine block, but I wonder if the Tesla is crash tested with
luggage in the frunk, or always with it empty.

People are going to be putting stuff into the frunk, even stuff that may be
really solid and pointy and likely to breach into the cabin in the event of a
crash.

Is it especially armored to deal with those situations? Or should Tesla owners
generally keep it empty if they're concerned with safety?
