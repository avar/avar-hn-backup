Isn't it interesting that despite a lot of Sander's voters being against the
outcome of Citizens United that his very presence as a viable candidate at this
point is in a way a demonstration of the point the Supreme Court made in their
majority opinion?

I.e. here we have a guy who's not taking donations from big corporations, but
is just as visible as Hillary who is. Money's speech apparently, and either
lots from a few big donors or small amounts from lots of small donors counts.

Regardless of what happens with this election I think what's happening so far
is indicative of a major change. If things keep going in this direction the
2024 election is going to be very interesting indeed.
