It's faux-open because it's not developed in the open. Google just code-dumps
Android after every major release, only OEMs have access to development builds.
If you don't get a Google paycheck it's thus very hard to contribute to it as
an open project.

It's faux-open because almost every single Android device needs proprietary
kernel blobs & firmware to operate almost any non-trivial hardware feature on
the device. In practice this pins you to specific kernel versions/APIs, and
you're running code you can't change or even audit.
