That's amazing. A facility with 1600 employees that needed untold resources to
construct is decommissioned as useless because the Washington Post writes an
article about it.

They're of course within their rights to do so, but it's sad to think that all
the work needed for the facility went to waste and its employees were laid off
just because someone wrote an article on it.
