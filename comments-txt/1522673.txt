It's not fundamentally different. Wikipedia is explicitly like traditional
encyclopedias in that it's not a primary source, and that it only wants
articles about things which can be reliable cited in multiple primary sources.

Articles about random Internet personalities or some garage band are thus
inherently not in the scope of the project, until they become more notable.
