For someone that's scientifically minded anecdotes like the ones you've
described would actually count against the idea, not for it.

Why? Because human beings are very bad at intuitively interpreting information
methodologically, this is why we have things like double-blind trials in the
first place. It's very easy to subconsciously stack the odds in your own favor.

I'd encourage you to read up on James Randi and some of the people that compete
for his million dollar challenge. Everyone that takes it is equally convinced
(as you are) of their woo-woo ideas, and all of them are proven equally wrong.

You aren't immune from deluding yourself, and neither am I. Nobody is, that's
why we have a process to factor human error out of the equation. It's called
science.

In this case we aren't talking about some harmless and quaint idea. If you
continue foistering homeopathy on your loved ones, there's a real possibility
that the magical thinking will rub off on on them. And they'll subsequently
neglect to seek real medical attention when they have a problem that can't be
solved by a glass of water and a friendly smile.
