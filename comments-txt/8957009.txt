It's really hard to quantify NASA & military spending though, a lot of that
money was already spent by the military on ICBM research, which coincided
nicely with trying to send people to space.

To get an accurate number you'd have to take the amount that the US was
spending on ICBMs, and ever more accurately how much the Third Reich was
spending on research for the V2s etc. After all the US military & NASA
benefited immensely from Wernher von Braun and other German scientists that
delivered Nazi rocket research to them after WWII.
