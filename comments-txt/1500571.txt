They Reykjav√≠k municipal government headed by The Best Party is using a web
application to solicit ideas: http://betrireykjavik.is.

The source is up on GitHub: http://github.com/rbjarnason/open-direct-democracy

It's not perfect, but it's a step in the right direction. You can vote things
up or down, make arguments for and against proposals etc.
