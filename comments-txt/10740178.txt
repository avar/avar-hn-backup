Well, this has always been the interesting case with these lawsuits against
Wikipedia/Wikimedia. The local chapters do not in any way run their respective
language editions. After all, why would the Wikimedia Germany and not the
Austria or Switzerland chapter run the German Wikipedia?

Even if the heat was turned up on Wikimedia Deutschland as a result of
something like this they'd be unable to dictate what goes into their language
editions of Wikipedia. The local chapters simply have nothing to do with the
editorial policy.

There are plenty of German speakers who edit Wikipedia who live outside of
Germany, some even live in the U.S. Is a German court ruling going to decide
whether a German speaker living in the U.S. can insert factual information into
a U.S.-hosted encyclopedia article about some subject pertinent to Germany?

The entire legal framework around this sort of thing is based on the assumption
of locally published paper media, and it's really interesting to see how these
cases are treated in the Internet age where it's not a case of local publishing
in your country, but your citizens fetching foreign-published information over
international boundaries.

So I'm genuinely curious to know what their standing in the case was considered
to be.
