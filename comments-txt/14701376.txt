    > plutonium, which is in very low supply.

Thermoisotopic generators are a bad idea for general power generation for a
colony for other reasons (they're low power, you need a lot of them), but it's
not a problem that they're in low supply.

That's just because we haven't been making more plutonium recently, because we
haven't needed it. We could simply make more.
