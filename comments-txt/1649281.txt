I don't own an iPad but I think Apple's non-support of Flash is great. It's
shipping the first major web browser in the last decade that's explicitly not
supporting flash.

So it's helping to make Flash more irrelevant every day, by forcing developers
to finally consider that delivering their content in some executable binary
blob isn't a reasonable thing to do on the web.

Thanks, Apple!
