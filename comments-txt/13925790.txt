This is obviously a joke, but here's a serious reply to it: There will already
be serious Y10K problems in 9997, just like there were Y2K problems earlier
than 1997.

Epochs & date formats aren't only used to represent & display the current date,
but dates in the future, e.g. think about reservation systems, graphing
libraries that display things 10-15-50 years in the future etc.
