Most people using gettext get it via their package system. Your library is also
an external tool they need to similarly fetch & install.

And no, my argument is not similar to your IDE comparison. You'd get the exact
same thing, parsing / compiling when you compile your project. You'd just
offload slightly more work to make & the linker.

You can also get access to the parsed version as a datastructure. This is what
the gettext library does with its compiled *.mo files.

Anyway, I don't think your thing is a useless approach. It's very hacky in C++
but this sort of thing is the best way to do something like this in many other
languages.

I was just pointing out that there's decades of precedence for achieving the
same results in C, i.e. parsing some custom language out of the project at
compile-time and shipping it with the binary. Which you (with your "what else
is there" question) seemed to be unaware of.
