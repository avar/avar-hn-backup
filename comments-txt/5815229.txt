Very true, but to add to that another factor that shouldn't be underestimated
is that it's companies advertising on these platforms that are footing the bill
for their operations.

Fewer companies will want to advertise with you if their company/product page
can be disliked. To name an example Monsanto has ~22k likes (https://
www.facebook.com/MonsantoCo) they'd probably have at least two orders of
magnitude as many dislikes if people could "dislike".
