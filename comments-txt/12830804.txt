The party's main policy for this election isn't to try to enact direct
democracy. It's something they have as part of their core policy[1]. You can
read about what they want to accomplish in the shorter term here[2].

They'd like to sensibly work towards more self-determination and greater direct
participation in the government, not try to establish direct voting on every
issue and abolish parliament.

I think you're mistaken about more direct democracy being some easy part to
tyranny. Right now if the majority in Iceland wanted to say, completely
restrict freedom of speech, this would just be the main issue in the next
election. Some tyrannical party would get voted into power and they'd make it
the law. No direct democracy needed.

Of course there's something to be said about the moderating influence of the
time delay required for that, but there's other ways to achieve that.

I think you're missing what a moderating influence it can be for a society to
feel like they're directly involved in decision making, and how that could be
an even bigger moderating influence than directly removing power from the
population.
