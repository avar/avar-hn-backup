Whenever UBI comes up some proponents of it support it largely on the notion
that it could actually save money by abolishing the bureaucratic social welfare
we have today.

Lots of comments here are pointing out something to that effect.

Which makes OPs question less absurd, because it goes to 1) How many selective
welfare programs should still remain? 2) If #1 is large enough does the "but it
can replace existing welfare programs" argument for UBI make sense?
