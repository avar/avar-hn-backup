Reading over the Wikipedia article[1] it seems that you're historically at
least somewhat correct, since this tax used to be directly based on the price
of the car, but since 2007 it's been partially and then in 2010 entirely based
on CO^2 emissions.

There are other tolls & fees for owning a car in The Netherlands. I don't own a
car, but from what I've read taken as a whole the tax policy here has nothing
to do with "luxury", you're free to buy a million Euro gold-plated scooter.

It's meant to discourage excessively heavy vehicles and those who pollute more.
Any sort of a flat fee that doesn't take into account the weight / size of the
vehicle doesn't account for the disproportional cost to infrastructure incurred
by larger & more polluting vehicles.
