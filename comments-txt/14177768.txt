IRC also needs someone to run a server. Just because a protocol isn't p2p
there's plenty of reason to open it. You can independently develop third party
clients, use your own server instead of Apple's etc.

They simply lied. They never said "We'll open Facetime, but only if it's
implemented as a p2p protocol & client"
