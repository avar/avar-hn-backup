I was deeply into Nintendo games in the late 90s leading up to Wind Waker's
release. I remember after it was announced that so many people were deeply
disappointed in these "kiddy" graphics.

Remember that as far as the major releases go it was released in 2002 after
Ocarina of Time in 1998 (and a sequel using the same engine in 2000).

People wanted a "real" Zelda game with "real" graphics, like what became
Twilight Princess in 2006, whose graphics are a logical follow-up to Ocarina of
Time.

It's funny how history turns out, now Wind Waker is widely lauded for its
graphics, and it looks much better than the likes of Ocarina of Time or
Twilight Princess.

It's a fantastic example of how Nintendo is still a company that dares to
experiment, even with their most wildly successful game franchises. That hasn't
always worked out, but we've gotten amazing innovative games like Wind Waker as
a result.
