Don't get your hopes up. NASA has a long history of pre-teasing these
announcements, and then it turns out to be some announcement that while
marginally interesting scientifically, is really no big deal as a news story.

E.g. last year they pre-announced that they were going to make some big
announcement about Mars, and everyone was thinking "evidence of life?". And it
turned out to be that they'd just found evidence for brine flowing on the
surface in some cases[1].

While that was certainly interesting in itself if you follow what's going on on
Mars, it was just an incremental addition to the knowledge we already had about
water on Mars.

My prediction is that this Europa announcement is going to be something
similarly mundane.
