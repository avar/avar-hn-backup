Yes, it doesn't, and can't. But I'm saying that it doesn't matter.

When people visit "foo-bank.com" the easiest way to do a MitM is to simply do a
http MitM. Then you don't have to forge any SSL certificates, or rely on the
browser not yelling enough.

The only way to guard against that is to train users to recognize that they
shouldn't be sending money through a non-CA SSL connection, as indicated by
their browser with a friendly "Secure" icon somewhere.

Thus, if browsers treated non-CA signed SSL connections just like normal HTTP
connections, i.e. just used encryption, didn't present any "secure" banners
etc. you wouldn't make things any less secure.

Non-CA signed SSL traffic is just as secure as unencrypted HTTP traffic (i.e.
not), and browsers should treat both of them equivalently.
