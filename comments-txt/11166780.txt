What you're fumbling towards here is called the "hard problem of consciousness"
[1]. Essentially some believe that there's some secret sauce in the brain that
gives rise to consciousness, while others believe that there's no such "hard"
problem and that "consciousness" is just what we call a bunch of simpler brain
systems working in unison.

My opinion is a layman that's read quite a bit about this is that there's no
"hard" problem, and the only thing that separates us from "lower" animals is
just that we're running a slightly more sophisticated version of the same
physical brain processes, which we like to call consciousness.

There's no reason to believe that we're anything than the cumulative behavior
of our brain matter, or that we're somehow "special" in the animal kingdom in
another sense than e.g. wolves are more special & sophisticated than mice.
