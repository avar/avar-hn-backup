Aren't those numbers overwhelmingly related to someone leaving a gun in a
drawer at home and a toddler finding it? What does this have to do with airport
security? Do you think someone's going to accidentally bring a gun to an
airplane and their toddler somehow manages to find it during the trip and shoot
themselves?

That seems like an awfully contrived scenario.
