The inherent issue is that there's a huge performance benefit to be gained by
batching updates. FS safety will always come at the cost of performance.

The article doesn't say but I suspect most of the issues it mentions can be
mitigated by mounting with the "sync" and "dirsync" options, but that
absolutely kills performance.

The APIs involved could definitely be friendlier, but the app developer is
using an API that's explicitly performance oriented by default at the cost of
safety, and needs to opt-in to get safer writes. Whether the default should be
the other way around is one matter, but ultimately someone has to pick which
one they want and live with the consequences.
