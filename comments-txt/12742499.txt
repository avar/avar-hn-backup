Let's say there was a country where 0.5% of the drivers used seat belts[1], and
out of those mostly just race car drivers. Yet that country had no notable
increase in injuries or fatalities in car crashes as a result compared to
countries where seat belts were mandatory.

Add into that that in this parallel universe driving a car daily had big
long-term health benefits, and the introduction of seat belt laws in other
countries had caused driving to drop by 1/3 [2], causing fewer people to cycle,
overall health to decline, and a reduction in car safety due to less car safety
in numbers. Since a major cause of accidents was that few people used cars
daily, leading to accidents where people weren't expecting them.

Then yeah, I think it would be completely fair to question whether wearing a
seat belt in your car was worthwhile. But of course none of this analogy makes
sense, which makes your argument rather nonsensical.
