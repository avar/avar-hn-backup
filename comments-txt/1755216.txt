Bing Maps requires Silverlight for some features. I found that out when I tried
Bing recently, but found that Microsoft is more interested in pushing their own
technology than pushing their search engine.

Microsoft also recently did a project with NASA that requires Silverlight.
Thanks, Microsoft.
