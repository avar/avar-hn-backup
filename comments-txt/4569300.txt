How about not trying to solve this problem by artificially crippling the
software up-front and instead just leave it up to national governments to
regulate this sort of thing? We don't have special software in mobile phones to
make them turn off when they're in a car, we've just made it illegal to fiddle
with them while driving.

The same should work just fine for certain dashboard interaction.
