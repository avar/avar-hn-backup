I'm all for the development of electric cars but downplaying having to stop at
what's effectively a gas station in the middle of nowhere for 1.5 hours per day
is pretty disingenuous.

You wouldn't get a lot of people buying a normal gasoline powered car if it
took 1.5 hrs to fill it up each time, so electric cars have a lot to make up
for in other features if you're using them for road trips like this, rather
than just commuting where you're charging overnight.
