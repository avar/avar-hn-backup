That's comparing apples to oranges. A proper comparison would be to create an
individual Git repository for each article, not a giant repository containing
all the data in Wikipedia.

That would work more like the current MediaWiki storage backend does, and would
probably do delta compression of old revisions more efficiently than the
current homebrew code.
