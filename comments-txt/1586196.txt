I usually agree with or sympathize with Moglen's views but this is just
indefensible.

He's saying that Steve Jobs is "a man whose selfishness surpasses any recorded
selfishness", and why? Because he opted to support a modular compiler started
at the University of Illinois instead of the GCC.

The LLVM's license is free, and even classified as such by the FSF. To smear
participants in a fellow free software project like this or those that fund it
is beyond low.

I lost a lot of respect for Moglen after reading that.
