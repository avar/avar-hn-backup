Any usage of the exploit by the NSA constitutes leaking it.

You can't treat cyberweapons like normal weapons.

The analogy is not that you come up with a secret bomb design and drop it on
the target, but that to use your bomb you must send the full Top Secret designs
for the bomb to every target, hoping that they voluntarily use it to blow
themselves up instead of writing the design down & using it against you.
