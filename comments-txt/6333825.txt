Indeed, I love stopping at random places when I'm on the road.

Having to spend 1.5hr per day at a gas station is not a random stop however,
and having to spend 1.5hr per day at one in lieu of stopping somewhere more
interesting takes some of the fun out of driving and stopping at interesting
places on the road.
