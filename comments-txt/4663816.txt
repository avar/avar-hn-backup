I wonder how vulnerable this approach is to timing attacks similar to the ones
you can use to smoke out onion routed machines.

If you know the physical and network location of their routing boxes and you
keep polling some (e.g. static) resource on their servers you can eliminate all
cloud providers that are further away than the response time as being the
hidden backend.

Let's say you narrow it down to 10 candidates and 5 of them experience some
sort of network issue that gets reflected in the response times of TPB, you've
now narrowed it to 5.

I wonder what they're doing to mitigate these sort of timing attacks meant to
discover their hidden backend.
