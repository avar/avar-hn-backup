    It's not as if rebase is commonly used.

This is widly incorrect. Powerusers of Git use rebase extensively, pretty much
every patch that makes it into Git itself has been rebased at least half a
dozen times.

I rewrite my history constantly, because when writing code I commit all the
time, then I squash commits together later and give them proper commit
messages.

I wouldn't use any SCM tool that wouldn't give me this functionality. The
result of recording all history permanently is that users will just not commit
their incomplete work, meaning that it'll be in their working tree instead of
tracked in some form by the repository.
