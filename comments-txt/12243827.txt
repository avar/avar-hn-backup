It's not inside a mall, it's in a hawker center, a complex that doesn't have
traditional shopping and is literally many levels of nothing but small one-man
eateries.

Saying that it's not "street food", I think, glosses over the context of what
these things are in Singapore.

There was a concerted effort by the government at some point to bring what were
"street food" stalls in the western sense into regulated hawker centers for
hygienic reasons.

There's almost no "street food" in the western sense in Singapore, for a
combination of that reason and the fact that it's bloddy hot outside. While
Hawker centers usually don't have AC, they at least tend to have fans
everywhere, which makes it a bit more tolerable than eating food outside in the
street.

It is street food in the sense that it's all really cheap food that's prepared
almost instantly, you can eat it in a hurry, and the Hawker centers are all in
major thoroughfares.
