What exactly about this suggestion for colonizing Mars has been falling on
"deaf" ears, who's been suggesting that we "improve [the] environment by force"
on Mars?

The few plans I've seen involve trying to terraform Mars slowly by introducing
something like genetically modified high-altitude lichen and going from there.
Of course in the process of doing so we'd use the organisms that work, not
"force" the things we wish would work.

The challenges of terraforming Mars will be very different than dropping a few
trees on Ascension Island, which is what the Royal Navy did.

As an aside, I recommend the Mars Trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson for an
overview of how Mars might be incrementally terraformed through that method.
