Is that really inherently different, or just a more complex manifestation of
the same basic principles?

I.e. Atoms repel each other because of their magnetic fields, and depending on
their polarity and spin in the aggregate they can produce bigger and more
complex magnetic fields, such as the ones analyzed by magnetohydrodynamics.
