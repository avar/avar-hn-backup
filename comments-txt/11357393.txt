I've been curious as to why the following strategy wouldn't work as a hack as
well:

* Your credit card has a balance of $0 on it

* You have some app that allows $NAME to deduct $X from it

* You transfer $X to it earmarked for $NAME for some limited amount of time.

I.e. you could walk into Starbucks, have an app on your phone to say you're
depositing $20 into an account earmarked for /starbucks/i for 30 minutes.
