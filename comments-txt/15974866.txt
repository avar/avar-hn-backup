If you mainly advertised for employees in certain newspapers you'd get people
of a given political leaning. If you advertised on the radio at 6 in the
morning you probably wouldn't get anyone under 35.

It's not obvious to me why employers should be able to use the implicit
filtering traditional media provides, but not the explicit filtering new
advertising platforms provide.
