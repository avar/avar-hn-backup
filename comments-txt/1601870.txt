Well, firstly this isn't a big problem for HTTP based services like justin.tv,
almost all Tor exit nodes allow HTTP exits, but it's a bigger issue for
non-HTTP exits.

But the better way is to take into account exit policies. Only ban access from
those IPs that are Tor exits and allow access through to justin.tv.

You can query the exit policies of a given exit with TorDNSEL: https://
www.torproject.org/tordnsel/

I also whipped up a quick script that can be fed a list of Tor exit nodes on
STDIN and will spew out a list of exits that aren't allowed to access a given
IP:PORT: http://gist.github.com/523328

According to that 5/1338 Tor exits have policies that don't allow exits to
justin.tv on port 80 (199.9.249.22:80), but e.g. 309/1338 ban exits to
irc.freenode.org:6667.

That means that justin.tv is needlessly banning ~0.4% of Tor exit nodes, but
someone using the same approach with an IRC server is needlessly banning ~23%.
With SMTP (checked on a random GMail server) that percentage rises to 98.8%.
