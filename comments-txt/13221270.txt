Don't you just mean some Linux distros & BSDs? I don't see any indication that
ncal is standardized by POSIX: http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/

According to the Linux manpage it's a FreeBSD command originally introduced in
FreeBSD 2.2.6 in 1998: https://www.freebsd.org/releases/2.2.6R/announce.html
