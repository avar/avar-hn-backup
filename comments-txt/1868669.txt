The idea was that their network protocol was an original copyrighted work, and
that any clean-room implementation of it would be a derived work.

That does indeed sound crazy, but they also had piles of cash to throw at
lawyers to go after anyone who challenged them, and (maybe as a result of that)
nobody ever made e.g. a clean-room BSD or LGPL licensed version of the mysql
library. So it never made it to court AFAIK.
