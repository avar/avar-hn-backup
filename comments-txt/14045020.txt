I'm not concluding that "the EU is just as bad as the US", and really, I can't
see how you could possibly come to that conclusion after reading my comments.

Yes, on average pretty much any part of the EU is better when it comes to
homicide statistics. All I've been pointing out that from looking at the
homicide & gun death statistics in the US you can't conclude that guns are
important variable driving those statistics.

You're the one who started injecting suicides into the discussion. In your
earlier comment[1] you said, in response to a graph[2] I posted that included
non-suicide numbers, which is the part I was citing, that the "lowest groups
are 2-7". Those numbers include gun suicides, whereas I wasn't talking about
that at all but the other data on the page which shows gun homicide statistics
similar to the Dutch 0.58.

But since you muddied the water by bringing up these unrelated suicide numbers,
I started to itemize the suicide & the non-suicide you were conflating them
with, and now a few comments later you're complaining about my discussing
something you brought up in the first place.
