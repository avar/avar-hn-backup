This just raises more questions. If the transfer of liability to family members
isn't a thing wouldn't this just be thrown out at first hearing as a frivolous
lawsuit?

And it's shameful to be sued but not shameful to file obviously frivolous
lawsuits, or at the very least being the subject of a frivolous lawsuit would
imply no shaming?
