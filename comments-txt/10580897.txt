You might be interested in reading The Moral Landscape by Sam Harris for an
in-depth start at an answer to that question.

It's a secular look at morality and how we can reason about morality without a
foundation of unscientific ideas (e.g. the existence of a deity).

In essence it makes the point that the religious idea of morality driven by a
god with a big stick in the sky who'll discipline you if you step out of line
isn't moral at all, and neither do most religious people actually adhere to it
in practice.

E.g. we're not stoning homosexuals or burning witches as we once were, and it's
not because the scripture changed, but because of secular progress despite of
scripture. How do you decide which instructions to cherry-pick from the Bible
or whatever piece of scripture it is you believe in?

He essentially defines an act as "good" if it's a net increase in human
happiness and well-being. Burning people to death of persecuting homosexuals,
not so much. Looking out for your fellow man so he'll look out for you. Note
that this isn't the same thing as reducing morality to hedonism.

Anyway, I'm doing a poor job of paraphrasing the gist of that book so I'll
stop. But if you're genuinely interested in what constitutes a good act or
moral behavior in the secular sense there's a lot of well-researched and
interesting works you can read on the subject.
