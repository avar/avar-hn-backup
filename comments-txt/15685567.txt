A few years ago the Bloomberg story "Where Is Germany's Gold?"[1] made the
front page here with a lively discussion [2].

That article has a very different take alleging some conspiracy and the US's
unwillingness to return the full amount.

This article has none of that. Has the Bloomberg article been shown to be wrong
since it came out, or is there still some untold story here?
