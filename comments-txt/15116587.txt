    > No IRB, no oversight by the FDA

Yes of course domestic US agencies don't oversee or regulate medical trials in
other countries.

The article explains that these agencies would need to be involved if this
research yields a drug destined for the US market.

It doesn't make it unethical either. My primary beef is with the lazy way the
article is written. Maybe this trial is unethical, maybe it isn't.

But the argument put forward in the article would equally apply if this
research were done in the EU. I.e. that it's somehow inherently bad that US
regulatory agencies aren't involved in medical research that happens abroad.

    > they deliberately chose to evade strong oversight.

Maybe they did. Companies selectively choose legal jurisdictions based on
regulations all the time. E.g. EU food regulation is stricter than US
regulation. Would you say that it's unethical for a EU company to fund food
startups in the US for that reason?

The article quotes Thiel as saying "you would not be able to invent the polio
vaccine [in the US] today". I don't know if that claim is true, but if it is
(or even if today the vaccine's introduction to the market were delayed
compared to the 1950s) this whole question of "unethical" trials v.s. overly
strict regulations becomes much more complex.
