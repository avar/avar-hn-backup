To amend that a bit, it has something to do with fast drives, i.e. of course a
fast drive will speed up your first invocation, but unless your system is under
a lot of memory pressure subsequent invocations will be in the FS cache making
the drive speed irrelevant, which is the common case for working with Git
repositories.
