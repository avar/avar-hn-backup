I'm happy that we don't use your personal desire for ignorance as a guide when
forming public policy.

The point of these sorts of laws "public persona" laws is not that we all
desperately need to know trivia like George Clooney's natural hair color or
what year Evelyn Schels was born, but rather that when you insert yourself into
the public sphere you're free game for the public press because it's in the
public's interest do know who you are and what you represent.

The press is one of the fundamental pillars of any functioning democracy, and
if you can't write a basic article about some public personality without
mentioning how old they are or other pertinent personal attributes without fear
of legal retribution you've enacted a major barrier to public discourse.
