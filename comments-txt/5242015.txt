I have a new Dell E6330 which is certified to run with Ubuntu, and came with it
pre-installed: http://www.ubuntu.com/certification//hardware/201202-10559/

I immediately wiped it to install Debian (I'm not accepting a Dell EULA to run
Linux) and found that the touchpad wasn't detected as such. Some digging
revealed that there was a third party patch to linux reverse engineered from
the Windows driver, not one contributed by Dell.

So it seems that their efforts to upstream code required to run their hardware
on other distros than the OEM image are non-existant. The Ubuntu image that
comes with them also possibly contains binarf blobs (didn't check since I
didn't install it, but the Ubuntu page mentions than only the OEM image is
certified, not stock Ubuntu).
