The allies discovered a bunch of gays locked up in concentration camps under a
1935 Nazi-enacted law, didn't repel that article similarly to e.g. laws against
Jews when WWII ended and supported their re-imprisonment, nor did they make
their times in the concentration camps count against their "crimes".

Granted saying they were "fine with it" might be a bit of an exaggeration. But
I don't think it's unreasonable in the face of historical evidence to think
that the concentration camps would have been treated vastly differently by the
allies if the only prisoners were homosexuals, given how the allies treated
those prisoners upon their release.

Which I think goes to show that the allied forces didn't have an intrinsic
objection to what went on in the concentration camps, they just minded the
target audience the Nazis picked.
