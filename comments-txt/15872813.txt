Which is clearly not enough, as detailed in the article. If people only had to
pay with their own time they would, and the road would be congested, hence the
high toll. This is basic supply & demand.

You just keep asserting that people should pay for their pollution, I agree!
But that's not always the maximum price you should pay.

Which would be another case of not charging based on the actual cost. You could
drive your street legal car around in circles on a private track, and you
should pay almost no road tax, but someone who exclusively uses public roads
should pay more. Under this scheme you'd pay the same for both cars.
