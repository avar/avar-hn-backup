Russia didn't invade Crimea out of the blue. From Russia's perspective the
start this whole thing is closer to when the US helped overthrow Ukraine's
government and was actually caught on tape micro-managing some of the
government transition[1].

Imagine what the US would do if, for instance, Russia were to help overthrow
Mexico's elected government and install parties friendly to its own interests
in their place.
