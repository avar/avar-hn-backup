The map you're linking to shows Argentina claiming much of the Antarctic.
Leaving the Falklands aside, it should be obvious that a map like this is
rather one sided and certainly doesn't have any international recognition given
that no sovereign claim over the Antarctic is recognized by the UN or anyone
else.

Aside from that I think you're misunderstanding what this map means. There's an
international convention on continental shelves but national sovereignty
supersedes it. There's no rule that if your continental shelf intersects
territory intersects some island you own that island.

If it did then China would own Taiwan, France / Belgium / The Netherlands &
Norway would own the British isles, South Korea would own Japan etc.
