I don't buy that. Almost all software is the equivalent of toilet paper, it's
something auxiliary that should perform a service so that you can get on with
your life.

Just because people demand a different color toilet paper (free software) the
demand doesn't go away.

If everyone demanded that software be free we'd still have cellphones, search
engines and games because people want that stuff, and they're going to pay for
it one way or the other.

Of course business models would be different, but the end result probably
wouldn't be. The main difference would be that there'd be more collaboration on
shared problems (like game engines), instead of each proprietary software
company coming up with their own solution.
