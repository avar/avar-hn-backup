    > That's an argument against patents existing at all.

No it's not.

It's not an argument for or against patents, I'm pointing out that @aroch is
wrong about them "patenting the processes".

That's not true for most of these patents, they're patenting isolated
organisms, compounds or genes. I.e. the end result, not the process.

What incentives we should give individuals and corporations to advance
biotechnology is another matter.
