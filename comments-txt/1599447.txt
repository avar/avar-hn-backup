Wikipedia has branching now in the form of "approved revisions", and it has a
lot of long standing TODOs like annotate that would be solved by a SCM.

The storage backend for articles is its own mini-scm with a revision table +
text storage. There's no reason why a Git based backend would be any worse of a
fit for a wiki.
