If the offer is annual and they add an extra $1000 per year then on average the
disgruntled employee has to wait 6 months to quit and get a higher severance,
not 1 year. Which means that 1/4 of those employees only have to churn through
3 more months to get an extra $1000, hardly something nobody would do.

The obvious solution to fix this flaw in the system would be to raise the offer
daily instead of annually, be approximately $1000/365 =~ $2.74 per day. Or more
simply by $20 per week, which comes out to about the same per year ($1040).
