No I mean support in the same sense you do. Their "supported" OS's are
obviously just things they have access to, and know that it compiles & tests
fine there.

E.g. they only have AIX 5 in "perhaps", that's only in the "Best Effort"
category in Perl's case because a few dedicated individuals still build and
test on it before release.
