Sounds like your friend went through a half-assed ad-hoc diet & exercise
program, which unsurprisingly didn't yield results.

Extracting any useful data from "I have friends who..." is impossible. People
are notoriously bad at self-evaluating things like their food intake or
exercise regiment, and on top of that they're prone to present themselves in a
good light.

You'll find few people who'll say "Yeah I could have lost/gained weight, but I
lack the dedication and impulse control to manage my diet & exercise", even
though that may be the description that best explains the situation.
