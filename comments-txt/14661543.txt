Yes, but this is actually instructive. Google is not a Canadian company, so the
more accurate comparison would be the US trying to control who the Russian
Kalashnikov Concern sells AK-47's to, just because they're also for sale in the
US.

Nobody's advocating that the likes of Google should be immune to everyone's
laws, but rather that it's overstepping that any given country is going beyond
just instructing an international corporation on how to behave within their
borders.

So if Saudia Arabia decides that showing any images of women more revealing
than the niqab in Google Images that should be applied globally? This is just a
recipe for a race to the bottom.
