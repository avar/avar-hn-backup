You normally can't stall an Airbus aircraft, except in cases where the flight
mode changes as it did in this situation. This was a huge part of the problem,
an emergency occurred and the pilots were effectively flying an aircraft they
hadn't flown before.

Fully pulling back the stick is what you'd normally do in an Airbus to gain
altitude. It's guaranteed not to stall the plane.
