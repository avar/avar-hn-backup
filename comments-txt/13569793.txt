I'm completely unfamiliar with the Canadian real estate market, but where I
live your ability to get a loan depends on your income and ability to pay the
loan.

Given that, why does it matter if someone in Canada had a $200K home and the
market dropped 30%, v.s. someone who had a $2M home and the market dropped 30%?
Surely their earnings were priced into the loan?

Or is the Canadian real estate/loan market so insane that nobody asks you if
you can plausibly pay for the loan you're taking?
