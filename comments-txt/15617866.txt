I think PM brought wide attention to it, but it's not like it's just some
fringe theory of theirs, see e.g. this CBS report [1] from 2012 (after the PM
article was published) with Captain Chesley Sullenberger (of the 2009 Hudson
crash fame). Many aviation experts have weighed in on this.

Yes they don't have all the data, but they have enough to draw this sort of
conclusion, including flight path, status of the plane at any given point, and
the cockpit transcripts.

And true. Suggesting the fleet would be grounded was hyperbolic on my part. But
I stand by my general point. Aside from happened in this accident, you're
assuming that anything worthwhile to be learned from a given incident must be
covered in the final report, or it must not be worth considering at all.

This expects too much of accident investigators, and doesn't account for the
sort of institutional blindness that happens when everyone is used to things
being done a certain way. Of course that was pilot error, two disconnected
joysticks are just how planes are flown!

This wasn't the first case of an incident being attributed to Airbus's
overdesigned flight controls, QF72 [2]. comes to mind.
