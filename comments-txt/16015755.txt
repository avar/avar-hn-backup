Flying jumbo jets is bad business these days, but the immediate reason for why
these carriers dropped the 747 in 2017 was because starting in 2018 they
wouldn't have been allowed to fly due to new FAA rules around fuel tank
inerting.

Of course putting "we won't be allowed to fly them since the regulator thinks
they're too likely to explode coming next year, but we're still selling flights
on them!" in your own press releases is bad for business, so most of the news
only mentions other reasons.
