The coercion justification is really bizarre though. The only reason anyone
could coerce you because they know you smoke pot is because it's a big deal to
the NSA, so the NSA asks because they know that because of their self-imposed
policy it creates the possibility for coercion.

If instead they just decided that if they found out one of their employees
smoked pot that they wouldn't care the coercion potential would magically
disappear overnight.

But I guess that's too logical for the government to consider.
