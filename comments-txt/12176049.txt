All the things you've listed fall squarely in the category of "we've lost the
hosting war, and nobody's going to ship proprietary .NET binaries on Linux
distros".

The further you go from that sort of thing where they've already lost the
market and either have nothing to lose or the writing is on the wall (how long
can paid-for languages truly compete with free ones?), the less they have open
sourced.

E.g. even Visual Studio which would be the next logical step is still for sale
starting at $500 on their website[1], maybe that'll be fully open one day.
After all how long can the paid-for editor wars persist?

What I was pointing out is that there's no sign of them opening up anything
that would truly make them an open source company. I.e. things they make real
money on, or would threaten their established lock-in.
