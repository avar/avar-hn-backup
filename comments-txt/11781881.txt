    > I hope you had some time to visit europe.

I've lived there my entire life, and not in native English speaking countries.
As I said at the start of this thread I'm not a native English speaker.

This isn't the case in all European countries. I don't think Germany, Italy,
Spain etc. are doing themselves any favors by doing this. Not dubbing your
movies is the perfect opportunity to teach your population the lingua franca,
they're missing out, and it shows in their English skills.

I didn't grow up with dubbed movies, and I think it helped by language skills
immensely.

Plenty of people learn English a near-native level without living in a natively
English speaking country. I did, just watch some TV (not dubbed) and read lots
of books (not translated).

I guess, maybe, but really this is never going to happen, we might as well
fantasize over how easy it would be if we did away with this whole
communication via sound waves fad, and just all learned the same sign language
instead.

We live in an increasingly globalized world, English is the de-facto world
language by sheer inertia. States that don't have it as a native language that
aren't teaching their children it at a native level are at a distinct
disadvantage.
