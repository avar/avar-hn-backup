    My impression is that the difference between Perl-5.6
    and Perl-5.12 is much less than between these versions
    of Python and recent releases.

Your impression is correct. Perl is a more mature platform than Python, and
backwards compatibility is taken more seriously. The latest Perl 5.12 release
can still run most of the test suite for Perl 1 released back in 1987.

That and its wide availability and portability make it a much better target
than Python for something like glue in a build system for a project that's
mostly in C anyway.

But even though it's backwards compatible with old code it's still somewhat of
a pain to write code that works on old releases that don't have the modules /
core features you want.

Backwards compatibility also comes at a price. Many of the changes that broke
old Python code broke it because old warts were being fixed in Python. There's
a lot of equivalent old warts in Perl that haven't been fixed, and there's no
plan for doing so (other than Perl 6).
