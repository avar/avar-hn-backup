It's licensed under the GPL, where you're not allowed to add any additional
terms. The citation notice it spews out is annoying, but can be disabled, and
you definitely don't have to include it anywhere.

The author just asks for citations because he's in academia, and citation
backrubs is how anyone can justify getting time to do anything (including
maintaining some software) in academia.
