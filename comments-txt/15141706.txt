When they're avoiding debris that's not something that would have directly
struck the station, rather they're aiming to keep debris from entering a 1.5 x
50 x 50 kilometer imaginary box with the station placed in the center[1].

So the inability to avoid debris realistically just increases the risk of
running the station, it doesn't mean that if they'd skip the next maneuver that
there's anything but a trivial chance of the station being struck.
