This situation is still perpetuated to this day. All of US and Israeli foreign
policy in the Middle-East basically revolves around containing the various
states there to keep there from being a unified Middle-Eastern superstate.

Which creates instability & low-level wars, which they'd prefer to having a
stronger state that would contain that sort of thing, but which might challenge
them on the international scene.
