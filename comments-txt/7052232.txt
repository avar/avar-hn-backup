I can't speak for Paris either, but when I was in Accra in Ghana around 10
years ago I found their approach to taxis fascinating. I don't know their
regulations for them but they seem to be effectively unregulated.

In that city what seemed like every 10th car or so is a taxi, it'll take you no
more than 30 seconds at almost any given point in the taxi to hail a cab. By
social convention the cab will stop for you even if it already has passengers,
if the passengers are going to a similar location they'll ad-hoc split the fee.

It was cheap enough due to the unregulated nature that you could take a cab for
all your trips, and there was almost no incentive to have a car in the city.
The number of cars overall was probably drastically reduced, and it was a much
more efficient system than any similarly sized metro bus or tram system I've
been to in a similarly sized city.

I don't know what the ideal system is, but consider the tragedy of the commons
you might be imposing by artificially driving up the price of what might
effectively become small ad-hoc point-to-point public transportation in lieu of
personal vehicles for everyone, or a larger and less efficient public
transportation system.
