This bit about ICU support v.s. glibc:

Is a reference to the PostgreSQL devs wanting to make their index order a
function of strxfrm() calls and to not have it change when glibc updates,
whereas some on the glibc list think it should only be used for feeding it to
the likes of strcmp() in the same process:
