A much more cost-effective way of dealing with radiation on Mars is to
construct shelters out of something that doesn't shield against radiation at
all, then only pick astronauts who are smokers, and send them to Mars without
cigarettes[1].

For the smokers sent to Mars living in flimsy shelters this'll decrease their
lifetime odds of dying from cancer compared to smoking two packs a day and
staying on Earth.

This article like so many others describes designs for Mars habitats that are
optimized for being accepted under NASA's strict safety rules, and it's an
organization run by safety-obsessed bureaucrats.

I predict that once the second space race kicks off in earnest these
unpractical restrictions are going to be quickly dismissed, because NASA's
going to have to compete with e.g. China which'll likely use much simpler
designs because they're realistic about their risk assessments.
