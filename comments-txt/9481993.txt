Passport goodwill is also another metric that's often overlooked. Would you
rather have to apply for a visa to enter a few obscure countries on the planet,
or regularly have to deal with scorn from border guards because your country
bombed theirs within living memory?

As an aside you're misinformed about what Schengen is. Having a passport from a
country in Schengen has nothing to do with being able to move to a different
Schengen country per-se. You're thinking of the European Economic Area.
Schengen is a passport-control free zone, whereas the EEA guarantees your
freedom of movement between any EEA countries, regardless of whether or not you
have to show your passport on arrival.
