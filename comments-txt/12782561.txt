I wonder if I'm the only one who finds water helps a bit. I know it's not water
soluble, but it has the effect of evenly distributing the burn around my mouth,
which feels better to me.

For some reason I'm a lot more bothered by extremely localized pain than evenly
distributed pain, when you chew a pepper you tend to e.g. disproportionately
burn on one side of your tongue. Drinking some water and swishing it around in
your mouth solves that problem.
