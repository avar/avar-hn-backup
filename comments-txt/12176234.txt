Yes it makes perfect sense that they're selling it. I'm not saying it doesn't.

What I'm saying is that the comments here to the effect of "Microsoft has
changed their stance" don't seem to be in touch with reality.

Microsoft has just realized relatively late that there's certain things that
they can't make money on yet are still strategically important, such as core
.NET technology, or JS engines.

That doesn't mean that they'll keep open sourcing stuff, or that they're not
likely to pull back the second they think it services their commercial aims.
