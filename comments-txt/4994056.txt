    > Normal people don't have the time to vote on every single issue

It's really easy to have both direct democracy and the convenience of not
having to vote on any given issue. You could grant the use of your vote to
another citizen or a group of citizens. If you don't like how they vote you
could instantly revoke their right to cast your vote on your behalf and go back
to voting on every single issue.

You could also grant use of your vote to different parties depending on the
subject matter, maybe you like Bob to cast votes for you on environmental
issues, but prefer Susan to do it if it has to do with foreign policy. Which
bucket an issue falls into could be handled similarly, a third-party you op-it
to trust to categorize issues before your vote is handed off to other parties
that are voting on your behalf.

Those are just some that come to mind, you could do much better. But the point
is that with modern technology it would be easy for everyone to choose where
they want to side on the direct democracy v.s. representative democracy
spectrum, and they could do so on an issue-by-issue basis.

The problem isn't that it's infeasible, it's just that nobody's tried because
it would take power away from those that are currently holding it.
