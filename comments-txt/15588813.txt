I may be wrong about this, but my understanding of the CC is that if say Nevada
were to enact a law saying that sales to California were subject to tariff they
wouldn't be found to be in violation of the CC. Instead they'd be found in
violation of some federal code that the government could enact because of the
CC.

I.e. the CC isn't some clause saying that free trade between states must be
respected at all cost (sans the 21nd). Otherwise why would there be a federal
drug law on the basis of the CC? That's a prohibition of the sale of certain
goods on the back of prohibiting sales across state lines on the back of the
CC.

Hence the indirect reply to SeanLuke upthread. This is not a violation of the
CC, but of some federal statute enacted on the basis of the CC.

The distinction matters because if the CC isn't an amendment that ensures free
trade the federal government could just as well use it to ensure trade
restrictions between states as free trade, which it mostly does today.
