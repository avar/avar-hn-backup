You should read about what goes on in countries that don't have this rule, even
countries you'd consider otherwise functioning western democracies.

The police "know" you're a pothead so they break into and search your house.
The search is entirely illegal but you go to jail anyway, after all they found
some evidence. If they didn't find some evidence that's just a fine paid out of
taxpayer money (police are similarly unaccountable almost everywhere).

By having the fruit of the poisoned tree doctrine police have a direct
incentive to follow due process to the letter, least they get evidence or their
entire case thrown out of court.

As other commenters here point out this doesn't always work out well in the US,
but at least it's better than nothing.
