Google has explicitly WontFix'd bugs on the subject of expanding incognito to
be hardened against fingerprinting: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues
/detail?id=142214...

Don't you think this sort of thing warrants a separate sort of browsing mode? A
lot of people who use the likes of incognito mode just use it for e.g. browsing
porn where they don't want the local history to be preserved.

Turning that mode into one that's highly hardened against fingerprinting would
in practice ruin the browsing experience for those users. Just look at what the
Tor browser needs to do with fixed preset resolutions, no JavaScript etc.
