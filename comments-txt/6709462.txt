The article does have such a separation, but you navigated down to the section
about the fifth season. Honestly, what were you expecting if not a summary of
what happens is that season?

Also, who should spoiler warnings in an article about a TV series benefit?
People who haven't seen the latest series? People who haven't seen it at all?

Should the summary say nothing about how Walt turns to crime (which wasn't
apparent to me when I started watching it), and instead describe Breaking Bad
in vague terms as the struggles of a New Mexico man to provide for his family?

Spoiler warnings are inherently at odds with writing a succinct and accurate
summary of a given subject, which is what Wikipedia strives to do.

Other commenters here are right, if you don't want something spoiled for you
then simply don't read encyclopedia articles about it.

You wanted some information about the structure of the aired episodes, there's
plenty of TV-guide like sources for that that aren't encyclopedias.
