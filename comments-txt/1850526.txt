THC can kill you in the same sense that water or any other non-toxic substance
can[1], if you consume enough of it it'll saturate your body and interrupt your
vital functions.

But to do that you need to consume much more than any person would do naturally
while smoking or eating it. E.g. you'd have to inject a 2-3 liters of it or
dissolved in a saline solution. Or smoke it so heavily that it starts
interrupting your oxygen supply, which is what they did in the "weed kills
monkey braincells" experiment).

1. Actually water is much more practically dangerous. Many people have died
from water toxicity.
