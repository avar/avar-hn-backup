I've tried all of those things. While Emacs deals with a lot of things really
well, I have around 100 terminal windows (screen sessions nested within screen
sessions based on topic) at any given time. While it would be neat to have that
all within Emacs for copy/pasting etc. since it's single threaded it just deals
with it horribly.

So instead I spawn Emacs just for editing/changing/email/finding, and do all
shell stuff through screen/ssh/bash.
