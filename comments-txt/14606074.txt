I have not been in an Uber in Amsterdam in the last couple of years that didn't
have a full Taxi license (posted in the dashboard) and where the driver was
legally permitted to take the bus/tram lanes.

From talking to a few drivers (just asking them about Uber) my understanding is
that at some point in Amsterdam Uber was just hiring pretty much anyone with a
car as a driver, but then The Netherlands cracked down on it, and now they're
all as legit taxi drivers as any other taxi.

So I believe you're posting on the basis of out-of-date information when it
comes to Amsterdam.

Uber's decline in Amsterdam will be not only when the local market provides
apps of equal caliber, but when they match Uber in prices, it's way cheaper
than taking a taxi over here.
