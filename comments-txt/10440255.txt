Good analysis, for those who have a knee-jerk reaction to this line of
thinking, consider how you'd feel if we were talking about terrorist groups
that we knew were planning massive strikes against civilization.

If you view deaths due to diseases that would be prevented by vaccination in
that light the money that we're spending on fighting terrorism versus spending
similar amounts (literally trillions of dollars) on eradicating diseases by any
means necessary (yes, even boots on the ground & forceful vaccination) the
situation starts looking very different.

Why can a few ignorant pockets of humanity hold the entirety of the rest of the
species hostage in perpetuity? And unlike some needing to take out some
insurgent group because they might attack the west it's pretty much guaranteed
that these diseases will flare up again, with guaranteed deaths for untold
amount of innocents. Just look at how close we came with the recent Ebola
crisis.
