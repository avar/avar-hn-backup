You're asserting that US interference in the Middle-East has caused present
Sunni-Shia conflict, which may well be correct. But I think your supporting
point of "it doesn't happen in other parts of the world" is weak.

Of course they aren't tracking down and killing each other in the US, because
they're both minority groups and probably rarely even run into each other.

That doesn't say anything about whether they would be doing so if they were
both in the majority and their sectarian conflicts were the dominant aspect in
society.

So if the governments in the Americas collapsed do you think the Sunnis and
Shias there would go right back to systematically killing each other? Could you
e.g. say the same thing about the Amish and the Mormons? Or is there a
pre-existing divede between these people that really has nothing to do with
external factors?

You can't both say that Sunni & Shia conflict happens in certain areas of the
world because of US foreign policy, and also suggest that Sunni & Shia
conflicts would arise between Muslims living in the US who aren't subject to US
foreign policy.
