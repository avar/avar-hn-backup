I think you've mixed up your #1 and #2 here.

    We choose the number #2. This caused #1 to immediately threaten to sue
    the company for racial discrimination. Why did we choose #1? Besides
    having never been late or used a sick day in the three years that he
    had worked for the company #1 had taken six voluntary workshops (#2
    had only taken one), and on his own time had learned German. The
    position that opened up would have required frequent interactions with
    our German branch. When we explained to #2 why he was passed over he

You mean you passed #1 over.

    screamed racism and stormed out of my office. He then sued the company
    and the company settled.
