Most of the competition deserved to die. At the time 10-50MB mailboxes were
normal, and Google came out with 1GB (and counting!) from day one, along with a
much better UI than everyone else, and kick-ass spam filters.

Nobody's done much more than reach parity with GMail since then, so there's
been no big incentive to switch back.
