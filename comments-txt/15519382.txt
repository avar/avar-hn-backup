Don't take this the wrong way, but I think a more accurate description of your
politics might be something like "an economic nationalist" instead of a
liberal.

By any global metric you look at globalization is doing amazingly. "A U.N. goal
to halve the poverty rate in the developing world between 1990 and 2015 was
nearly achieved twice over."[1].

The whole process of relaxing limitations on trade has been a huge boost for
developing countries who are currently on a runaway growth trajectory. E.g.
look at the GDP growth graphs for the developed v.s. developing world in this
[2] article.

Yes we could do better, but it's already great. Yes as some jobs move to
developing countries people in developed countries are temporarily displaced,
but there's no suggestion that we can't continually recover from that
situation.

After all our societies aren't overflowing with jobless ex-steelworkers,
ex-textile workers or any other industry you might want to name which has
predominantly moved abroad.

Instead we continue to lead the charge in economic development, but because of
globalization we're increasingly dragging the rest of the world with us.
