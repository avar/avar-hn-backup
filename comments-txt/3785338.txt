I completely agree, it's much better than GNOME 2.x. Another major thing that's
changed in my workflow is that I never use the menus to find programs anymore,
it's now much faster to use the built-in search engine to launch applications.
E.g. launching a terminal is Windows key + typing "Ter" + pressing Enter.
