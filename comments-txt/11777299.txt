Well of course population growth isn't the same as demand, that's the point!

What davidw was observing was that there's plenty of cities that do better at
satisfying the demand for housing than San Francisco does.

You can have a growing population in the same area while demand goes down, if
you're building enough new housing to offset the demand. The examples davidw
and I have been citing here show cities that have faced similar population
growth that have built up rather than succumbing to SF's housing problems.

I think your claim that it's apples to oranges is invalid. Yes SF has been a
boomtown, but plenty of cities all over the world have been boomtowns without
the same issues.

The issue is that SF has been a boomtown AND hasn't gotten its act together
when it comes to building up density. That's what makes it a special case, and
that's why both the demand for housing housing prices are ridiculous there.
