How do you propose to mediate trade disputes between companies and states
without something like the ISDS?

Imagine this on say the US national level. Apple wants to sell its computers in
Alaska, but Alaska has a domestic computing company that gets goverment
subsidizes, creating unfair competition. In this case the federal government
would step in.

There's an analogous issue with international trade agreements. National
governments will enter into those agreements, but their courts are always going
to be biased towards their local constituents, so in my example Apple couldn't
hope for a fair result by suing in Alaskan courts.

So there needs to be some pan-national body to settle these sort of disputes
without turning every little international company v.s. company or company v.s.
government issue into a full-on diplomatic dispute between the respective
governments involved.

The ISDS in the TTIP seems like such a facility. Why is it unreasonable? I'm
not some TTIP proponent or corporate shill, I'm just genuinely curious about
this, it just seems to me that a lot of comments on the Internet, including on
HN, have knee-jerk negative reactions to every provision in the TTIP without
thinking about the real issues those provisions might be solving.
