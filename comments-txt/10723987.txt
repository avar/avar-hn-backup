I'm getting more optimistic too, but I remain worried that there seems to be a
fundamental disconnect between scientists and the bureaucrats.

Science will find out that within some small error bar we need to do exactly X,
but bureaucrats see everything as a negotiation and will negotiate some number
smaller than X. Now we're still slowly getting boiled to death (bad) albeit at
a slower rate (good).
