Yes it's easier. It's also easy to just ban all of China. But the drawback is
that you're needlessly banning people who aren't doing you harm, and
discouraging others from running Tor exit nodes with limited exit policies.

E.g. I'd run a Tor exit node with policies that only allowed wikileaks.org and
a few other selected sites, but I don't. Because I know it'll cause me more
trouble than it's worth due to a bunch of overzealous administrators.
