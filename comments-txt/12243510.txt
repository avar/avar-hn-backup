The article doesn't make this obvious, but the Michelin Guide just expanded
into Singapore this year.

Singapore has some amazing food, and the hawker stalls are no exception. If
anything they exceed far fancier restaurants with their focus and authenticity.

But as far as this being news or worthy of HN goes, this just seems like
shameless corporate propaganda, even the video accompanying the article is
entirely produced by Michelin.

If anything I think the newsworthy aspect of it is why there's been literally
no street food stall in Michelin's established markets deemed good enough for
certification? Maybe I just have my guilty pleasures, but there's some truly
delicious street food to be had in Europe.
