Wetsuits are made of neophrene, they only work because neophrene is completely
waterproof. That's not the case with a pair of jeans and a sweater.

New cold water will seep through much faster than your body can warm it. Even
if you gained a fraction of a degree from tightly fitting clothes you'd lose
much more than that through lack of mobility.
