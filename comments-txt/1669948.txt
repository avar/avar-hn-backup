It doesn't make any sense to define a gravity field by photons. They're
massless, so they don't attract anything, and most of the photons a star has
produced over its lifetime are speeding away across the universe billions of
light years away from it.

Only things with mass can attract other objects with the gravitational force.
Photons aren't in that category.
