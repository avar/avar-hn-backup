It's like knowing that 1/2 dice rolls yields an even number, and after rolling
twice in a row and getting odds making a big deal of the supposed statistical
anomaly, because we got two odd numbers in a row we're really overdue for an
even number, don't you think?

When volcanos/earthquakes etc. are said to occur every N years, that's averaged
over geological periods. An event that occurs on average every 100 years over
tens or hundreds of thousands of years could be occurring once every 10 years
some millennium, or once every 250, 500 or 1000 years for some time span.
