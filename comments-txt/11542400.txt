You're conflating collision attacks like the Flame malware with a preimage
attack that would be necessary to produce a malicious Ubuntu release with the
same MD5SUM.

I.e. what's "broken" about MD5 is if you have a lot of CPU time and I allow you
to give me two unrelated blobs, you can craft those blobs to have the same MD5
sum.

What's not "broken" (beyond a theoretical 2^123.4 attack) with MD5 and not
broken at all for SHA1 is preimage attacks. E.g. if I work for Canonical, make
an Ubuntu ISO and you have to produce a malicious ISO with the same MD5 sum.

We should be considerate of collision / preimage attacks, but please don't
spread FUD by conflating the two. Publishing MD5 sums for ISOs is just fine.
