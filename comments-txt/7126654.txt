I work there as a senior developer and those blog posts couldn't be further
from the truth. There was some discussion about them on Reddit a while ago that
I contributed too (I'm "avar" there too): http://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments
/1mkdl4/what_exactly_is...

Anyway to reply to @csswizardry while we have offices worldwide (including in
SF) the only office where we're hiring developers/sysadmins is in Amsterdam,
and very small sysadmin operations in Seattle/Singapore that mostly handle
pager load outside of Amsterdam office hours.

If anyone's interested I'd be happy to field questions about it, my E-mail is
listed in my profile.
