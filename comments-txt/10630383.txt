You're not really addressing the grandparent's point. Why shouldn't you purely
punish culpability and ignore outcomes? It's seems way more logical and
everyone recognizes this on some level.

If I shoot you purely by accident most people will agree that I shouldn't go to
prison. It was an accident, I'm not a danger to society.

If I mean to murder you but my aim is off, or modern medical science manages to
keep you from death, how is society better off exactly by keeping me in prison
for a shorter time just because I wasn't successful?

The rational reason to put people in prison in the first place is because we
consider them a danger to society. Am I less of a danger to society just
because I was slightly incompetent on my first murder attempt?
