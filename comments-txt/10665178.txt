No it shouldn't. The Earth's climate has been at various extreme points in the
past, from ice ball to covered in tropical rain-forest.

That has nothing to do with the evidence for whether we're through human
activity pushing it towards one of those past extreme states at an accelerated
or unnatural pace.
