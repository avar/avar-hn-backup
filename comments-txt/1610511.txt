Tcpcrypt is aimed at passive attacks. Not everyone who has the power to listen
in and perform a passive attack can modify the traffic and execute an active
attack.

Even when you can do an active attack it's not trivial in practice. The user my
get suspicious if they've previously been able to initiate a tcpcrypt
connection but can't do so now, and if you do this on a big scale (e.g.
government sanctioned sniffing at an ISP) you'll probably be found out.
