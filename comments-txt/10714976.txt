I think the crucial difference is that when you talk about "open source X" it
means that any aspect of X can be modified as you please. Obviously when you're
talking about an open source iOS app it's understood that the underlying OS
isn't open source.

Since there is hardware that is actually open in that sense it's worthwhile to
distinguish whether you're talking about open hardware or merely open plans for
assembly of closed hardware.
