(Disclaimer again: I work for Booking.com in IT)

They don't forward your credit card as security. They forward it for the hotel
to charge you for the entirety of your booking.

Companies like Expedia follow the merchant model, they buy up hotels rooms in
bulk in advance and then re-sell them directly to customers. When you buy from
a merchant your credit card isn't shared with the hotel as there's no need to
do so.

Other companies like Booking.com and Agoda follow the agency model. They find
customers for the hotels, forward their payment details along to the hotel, the
hotel charges the customer, and then pays the agency a percentage of the
booking as an agency fee[1].

Both models have their pros and cons. The merchant model works brilliantly in
the US where large chains are the norm. It works less well in Europe where the
vast number of hotels are small properties.

It's fair enough that this makes you uncomfortable. But the hotel with that
printout has a contract with the credit card company like any other merchant
and is responsible for treating it responsibly.

I think you'd also be very surprised at the number of other merchants you might
deal with where this is the case. Having a printout with a credit card number
is not at all unusual in a lot of businesses.
