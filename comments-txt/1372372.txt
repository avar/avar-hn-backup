Do you have some statistics on that? Google probably does, and that probably
factored into their decision to not trust use the Accept-Language header as
their sole mechanism for deciding what language to serve content in.

Most computers with Windows sold in large markets like Germany probably send
the right Accept-Language headers, but there's a lot of localities where this
isn't the case.

Small countries like Iceland just use the stock English version of Windows,
then there's stuff like mobile devices which may not send Accept-Language at
all to think about.
