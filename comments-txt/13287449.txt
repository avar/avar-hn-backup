The Ehang 184 has 8 propellers, two for each of the four quad points. I'd
assume the reason is safety, that it can limp to the ground with just 7.

You're wrong about a quadcopter not being able to fly with 3 rotors, see this

That looks like it would be quite a ride with a human on-board, but would
probably suck less than crashing.
