Even if you could, that sounds like a bad idea. There's a lot of churn in the
hotel industry, the hotel you're booking 7 years out may not even exist in its
current form that far in the future, and if it does new/better/cheaper hotels
might have popped up next to it. 18 months in advance should be plenty of time.
