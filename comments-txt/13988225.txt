Being against nuclear for trivial reasons like these is why we have the
alternative: coal plants. Those kill an estimated 300,000 thousand people per
year[1].

It's only recently that renewables have become a realistic alternative in some
(but not all) cases, but for decades we've had people dropping like flies due
to coal, entirely because the public is too science illiterate to understand
that nuclear isn't anywhere as big of a deal by comparison.
