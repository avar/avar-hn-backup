You can't selectively tax certain goods without creating a market failure.

E.g. if the purchase of cars isn't taxed I'll just import â‚¬10,000 of audio
equipment by buying an old beater, then ripping out and selling the sound
system and selling the car for scrap, while making a big profit because I'll be
competing with local sellers that have to pay import tax on sound systems.
