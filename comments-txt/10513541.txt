I don't think they should. This way lies madness. You want e.g. the kernel &
packages to be pruned down to only have the things needed for each cloud host?

That means that for N cloud hosts Red Hat would have to potentially build N
different patches for any update or security fix.

Now you can't certify software to run on "RHEL 7" anymore, it has to be "RHEL
7, assuming it has XYZ, which some cloud hosts don't".

It can be done, but it's a huge hassle, it's much easier to just ship the same
distro to everyone. Space is cheap.
