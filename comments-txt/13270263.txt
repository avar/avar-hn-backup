Because certain types of technical advancement requires an element of devaluing
people.

"Calculator" used to be a job performed exclusively by humans. Moving to
mechanical & digital calculators didn't only require gains in efficiency, but
also a recognition that this was a job humans were simply worse at than
machines, so it was irresponsible to task a human with it.

Similarly self-driving cars can't simply be a nice thing to have, eventually we
have to have the discussion that it's irresponsible to have human driven
vehicles on the road.
