From Priceline's annual report in 2013 (the 2014 version is not released yet)
filed with the SEC[1]:

    During the year ended December 31, 2013, our international
    business (the substantial majority of which is generated by
    Booking.com) represented approximately 85% of our gross bookings
    (an operating and statistical metric referring to the total dollar
    value, generally inclusive of all taxes and fees, of all travel
    services purchased by our customers), and approximately 94% of our
    consolidated operating income.

Disclaimer: I work for Booking.com, but it's not like SEC reports are
privileged information. That Booking.com is most of the Priceline group is
obvious to anyone who looks up SEC filings.
