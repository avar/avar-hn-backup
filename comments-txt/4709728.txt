I've seen a lot written about the how of SecureBoot but is there a good summary
of the why's. I'm still deeply skeptical that this is part of Microsoft's plan
to eventually transform the PC architecture into something console-like.

They've already de-facto achieved that by not mandating that custom OS's can be
booted on Windows 8 supporting ARM devices, and between them and pressure from
content owners wanting complicit OS's that don't run applications that do
things they don't like I can only see that sort of thing progressing in the
future.
