Isn't the simpler & more plausible explanation that most individual foods
aren't measured like that, but rather just by summing up the protein/
carbohydrate/fat etc. amounts that go into making the food?

E.g. if you're making frozen pizza just add up flour, the pepperoni etc. you
put in and divide it by portion size.
