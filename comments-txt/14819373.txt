If it were to be accepted into Emacs itself that would only be the beginning of
the story.

Right now Magit is hosted on Github and anyone can contribute by just sending a
pull request.

If it were part of Emacs you'd need to use the FSF's collaboration tools which
have a higher barrier of entry, and if you're a first-time contributor with a
non-trivial contribution you're going to have to wait days/weeks as your
copyright assignment papers make their way over snail-mail.

I've contributed several (trivial) patches to Magit, zero to Emacs itself, and
would likely have contributed zero to Magit if it had been an FSF project to
begin with.

I think the FSF has gotten their priorities seriously wrong. The package is
already licensed under the GPLv3, they're wanting to subject everyone to a more
onerous contribution process to guard against the edge case of someone ripping
off one specific Emacs package and the FSF not being in a position to have
standing in court if they wanted to sue them.
