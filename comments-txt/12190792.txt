None of the actors in WWI were set on destroying or enslaving entire societies
within Europe. The losers would have been forced to live under a different
political system, not been subjected to genocide.

Would it really have mattered to the common man? Maybe not. did it matter to
the common man that he or his sons got sent away to war to die? Definitely.

Pacifism can be a sensible policy sometimes. Some wars aren't worth fighting,
even if you "win" or force a stalemate.
