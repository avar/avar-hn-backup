Apple isn't blocking contributions, they just don't care about them anymore
since they're going with LLVM/Clang. And since they don't care they don't have
the legal framework in place anymore to do copyright assignments.

The FSF could have these changes if they wanted if they didn't require
copyright assignment.

Personally I don't contribute to FSF projects because copyright assignments are
a PITA. I can see how a company that doesn't need to contribute to GCC anymore
just doesn't care enough to initiate the requisite legal work.
