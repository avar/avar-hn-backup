Here's the exchange, I found this hard to read without word-wrapping:

    Hi Andrew,

    My view concerning your request: no.

    Rationale: We're trying to build a more secure internet.

    Meta-level comment:

    You're a bit late to the party. We're metaphorically speaking at the
    stage of emptying the ash trays and hunting for the not quite empty
    beer cans.

    More exactly, we are at draft 15 and RSA key transport disappeared
    from the spec about a dozen drafts ago. I know the banking industry is
    usually a bit slow off the mark, but this takes the biscuit.

    Cheers,

    Kenny
