No, that's different. With a hidden service you're not exiting the Tor network,
but when you're exiting you always know where you're exiting from.

That's why the Tor project itself publishes a list of Tor routers and exit
nodes, if they didn't do it it would be trivial for someone else to compile and
publish the list.
