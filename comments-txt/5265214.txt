Here are some statistics about it: http://www.ncmec.org/en_US/documents/

The kid is probably more likely to be struck by lightning while you're walking
around in the park on an overcast day than being abducted by strangers.

But parents of newborns are rarely sensible about their risk assessment, and
obsess over amazingly unlikely scenarios while forgetting about the plausible
and common ones.
