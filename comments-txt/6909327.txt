What lesson would you draw from numbers like divorce rates anyway?

Say children from single-sex schools grow up to be in relationships that have
lower divorce rates. Does that mean that single-sex schools better prepared
them for marriage? Or are they just in unhappy relationships that children that
grew up in coed schools would know to end earlier since they've more inter-sex
socialization experience?
