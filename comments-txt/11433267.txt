The "activist" president description is quite biased, you could just as well
say that he's the first president who's been using powers legally and
unambiguously granted to him by the constitution.

I for one much prefer the rule of law to the vague rule of convention by
"nobody did that before so he shouldn't".

Now if people don't agree with his use of his presidential powers the right
thing to do is change the constitution, not complain about Ã“RG following the
law and his constitutional mandate.
