There's liability in a lot of countries, punitive damages aren't a thing in a
lot of them

So if your autonomous car kill someone you could just say "yes, shit happens,
we'll fix it, but look at how the death toll from vehicles has gone down
drastically due to this technology, maybe the courts shouldn't sue us out of
existence when the alternative is a drunk/distracted/incompetent human behind
the wheel?".

The OP is suggesting that that's going to happen in the U.S., maybe it will,
but that's not the reality in many other countries.
