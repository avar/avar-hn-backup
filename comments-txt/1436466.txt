No law has been passed yet, this is a "proposal for a parliamentary resolution"
(þingsályktunartillaga). Which basically means that parliament has expressed
formal interest in getting legislation drafted to implement this.

How that legislation will look will depend on a lot of committee work down the
road, and what parliament actually ends up passing is another open question.

Still, this proposal has the backing of several ministries, so there's a large
change that something good will be passed. But whether it'll fulfill all the
promises of the IMMI plan remains to be seen.
