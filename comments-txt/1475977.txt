It certainly has a lot of inertia. But most of its big projects started in the
old days are huge monolithic codebases that are starting to lose favor for
various reasons. Emacs because not everyone likes the UI (and it's impossible
to replace it, unlike other parts), GCC because Clang+LLVM are more modular and
reusable, automake because it's a huge and hard to learn mess while newer
systems aren't etc.

It's also losing some users like Apple and the BSD's due to the GPLv3
switchover.

I think that in the long term the GNU project will become increasingly
irrelevant due to most of their crown jewels being hard to maintain, and there
being political opposition to changing that.
