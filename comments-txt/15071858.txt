This doesn't inherently have anything to do with open source, but the problem
that whatever license the apps on the phone are under they can't all be
implementing their own push/pull message queue, having 30 open network
connections constantly waking up the phone is going to drain the battery.

If I install 100 apps that have their own messaging implementation should the
phone just not be showing that to me, even though my battery is now drained in
half the time as a result? I'm pointing out that as a user this is very
pertinent info to be showing me, if I have 30 apps running in the background
I'd like to see it.
