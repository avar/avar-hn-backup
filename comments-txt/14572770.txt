I'm pointing out the casual fallacy and blatant disregard for foreigners in the
GPs comments "leave behind a sick employee pool", as if though moving an
obviously dangerous job from their own country (with stricter safety
regulations) to another country will just magically fix the problem, as opposed
to just making people in some other country sick instead.

Assuming a world where every country had the same workplace safety regulations,
it seems obvious that a richer more developed country would be better prepared
to deal with workplace injuries and other ailments that result having less
strict regulation.

Which is why I'm critiquing the GPs comment as having more to do with
"nationalism than concern for overall human safety". We should be concerned
with the overall human cost of the products we use, not whether the people
injured in their production happen to live in place A or place B.

Some of the EU laws you mention are certainly a step in the right direction,
but they're only skin deep. No penalties are paid for outsourcing toxicity to
poorer countries during the normal import of consumer products, just for some
exports of toxic material. The former category is much larger than the latter.
