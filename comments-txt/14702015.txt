My original point was that dredmorbius's comment that Pu-238 is in low supply
wasn't referencing some law of nature, but a political decision that could be
changed.

I said they were a "bad idea for general power generation", so I'm not
suggesting that they be used to power a Mars colony, but rather that the
reasons not to do so don't include Pu-238 being in low supply.

We also have a low supply of rockets & other infrastructure to colonize Mars,
but we can simply decide to make them.

Still, I think any extrapolation of current numbers to say that Pu-238 would be
categorically unsuitable for such a purpose is probably premature. Nobody's
tried to produce it on a truly industrial scale, which would bring costs down.
It has a half-life of around 90 years degrading at 1%/year, so once you produce
it it'll power the colony for a long time.

It's also around 6% efficient at generating electricity[1], but 100% efficient
at generating heat, which is a huge part of energy requirements on Mars when it
comes to human habitation. The Curiosity rover generates 120W of electricity
but 2000W of heat.
