I'm having a hard time following this line of thought. Cattle was around in
some shape before what you could describe as modern humans existed. They need
plants that grow naturally and are sustained by the sun and some land. It's
clearly a sustainable process.

To the extent that it's not it might be improved by genetic engineering, and I
doubt that producing the same meat in vitro will be a net improvement in
sustainability for a long time. Now you've replaced a natural organism that
needs some fodder and produces CO^2 with an entire factory, employees to manage
it etc.

Why do you think that's more sustainable? One of those processes relies on
non-technology that existed before there were even humans around, and the other
needs high-tech that we don't even have yet.
