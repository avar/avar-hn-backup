    > Nuclear plants take a decade to build

That very much depends on the country & regulatory environment. If you browse
through the ones China has been building [1] it seems to be taking them around
5-7 years from breaking first ground [2] and 5 years or so to add additional
reactors to an existing site [3].

You can browse through other countries on that site & Wikipedia to see how long
these things take to build. The only ones that take more than a decade are ones
where the limiting factor is clearly not nuclear, but the regulatory
environment.
