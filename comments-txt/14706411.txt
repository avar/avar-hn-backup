I'm simply pointing out that if you'd like to imagine a world where the ADA
doesn't exist perhaps you can help yourself to a $500 plane ticket and say fly
to Japan or Europe. I was mainly responding to your hyperbolic statement that
the disabled could go to "a restaurant".

You'll find that the disabled have plenty of options, it's definitely not the
case that if you don't say enforce wheelchair accessibility for seating areas
that there are no restaurants around to accommodate the disabled.

But you do get a lot of hole in the wall places of a type I simply haven't seen
in the US, e.g. what would be a very small take-away restaurant in the US, but
with a ceiling high enough to have an upstairs floor accessible through some
very steep set of stairs to get to a seating area.

That's what I mean by society being poorer for it. It's not a choice between
waiving a magic wand to make everything wonderful for the disabled or not.
Complying with what amounts to onerous building codes can cost a lot, and often
that cost is so high that the establishment isn't viable anymore.
