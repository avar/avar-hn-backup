I see that I mixed up two of my laptops in my example. You're right, but my
general feature request still stands.

Yes the iwlwifi firmware in particular is shipped on the nonfree firmware CD
image. But the firmware my other laptop isn't. With the stretch rc5 non-free
image mounted:

    $ dpkg -c firmware/firmware-iwlwifi_20161130-3_all.deb|grep -c ucode
    46

But instead of providing the b43 firmware there's only a network installer to
fetch it:

    $ ls firmware/*b43*
    firmware/firmware-b43-installer_019-3_all.deb
    firmware/firmware-b43legacy-installer_019-3_all.deb

Looking over the packages more closely now it seems only the b43 package[1]
uses this approach (although there might be more firmware that's not included
at all).
