Here's quotes from a bunch of people interested in the subject on how this
would be useful, instead of me trying to repeat all of that: https://

It would be useful beyond some custom git-based solution because if what you
want is just a distributed ledger with safety & auditing built-in you can get
that off the shelf by leveraging e.g. the Bitcoin codebase. If you're doing
that with Git you need to write a bunch of custom software around it to arrive
at the same result.
