> Why does a bank give a 30 year mortgage to someone who is 70?

Presumably they're counting on the mortgage being paid off by the estate of
your fiscally conservative parents once they die.

Even if that isn't the case they can claim the townhouse from the estate and
try to sell it to someone else.
