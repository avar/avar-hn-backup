Relatively speaking this really couldn't be further from the truth.

There's plenty of codebases that implement some programming language and only
use C bindings for truly low-level primitives, such as external library calls,
memory allocation etc, leaving any substantial logic that's built on top of
those OS primitives to a higher level language.

Emacs is not such a codebase, most of the C code by volume is things that could
perfectly well be implemented in Emacs Lisp itself, but aren't because Emacs
Lisp is relatively slow.

So while it's fine for "scripting" Emacs itself, things like regexes, anything
that has to do with low-level character handling, most of the GUI layout of
Emacs itself (i.e. the buffer logic etc, not actually calling ncurses or X)
etc. is written in C.

Just browse through the C files in src/, most of this clearly has nothing to do
with interacting with low-level OS primitives: http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit
/emacs.git/tree/src
