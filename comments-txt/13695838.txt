I certainly don't think every discussion about any fictional work needs to be
turned into some Simpsons comic book guy analysis of the most minute of flaws.

Most sci-fi or fantasy works have some "gimme" that you just have to accept,
because it furthers the story. Fine, anti-gravity, time travel or whatever
exists. Nobody's expected to explain how it works.

What makes for lazy writing is introducing some world changing concept that you
base your entire story on, and then just conveniently leaving it out in the
very next scene for dramatic effect. That goes beyond having a gimme, you're
just assuming your audience is dumb at that point.

I think the book "Story of Your Life" is just fine. It's consistent with its
premise. As my comment indicates it's the lazy movie adoption I have a problem
with.

They depart from the book by making the character capable of changing the
future based on her prescience, she's no longer just a puppet playing out
future events. She's got a choice. Okey, fine, let's run with that.

But then she can see a future where here young daughter dies from some
incurable disease at a young age, but decides to have her anyway. Her partner
then leaves her because she went through with that without telling him.

I'd love to be a fly on the wall in the universe of the movie when they had
that conversation. He was probably yelling at her that they could have just
spent a couple of thousand dollars on sperm sorting & IVF and say had a boy
instead of instead of having their young daughter die at an early age from some
statistically improbable disease.
