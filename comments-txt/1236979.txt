It just seemed so plausible!

In 9.04 every time there was a notification you had to wait for it to disappear
before you could click on the buttons. In 9.10 they moved the notifications
down a bit as a hack around that.

Now in 10.04 the notifications are where they were but they've introduced a
social menu & moved the lock screen / switch user / shutdown menu to the
top-right.

If they hadn't moved the buttons it would be very easy to accidentally close a
window when you meant to use those new menus.
