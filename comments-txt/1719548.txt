First of all you should think hard before taking regexes from users. Even if
you do it correctly you'll still (presumably) need to search over your entire
dataset, instead of doing something more lightweight like rely on SQL indexes.
Use it with care.

You should use a regex engine that's explicitly designed to take potentially
hostile input. Like the Plan9 engine, or Google's re2 engine which powers
Google Code Search.

You can also just use Ruby's dangerous PCRE engine if you do something like
forking off another process with strict ulimits which executes the regex for
you. Then you can just kill it if it starts running away with your resources.
Look into how e.g. evaluation bots that work on the popular IRC channels on
FreeNode are implemented. POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::Eval on the CPAN is a
good example.
