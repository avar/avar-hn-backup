Well that's about as far from a valid analogy as you're likely to get. Rebecca
Black's "Friday" is the entire work, and if you told any high school student
"write me a song" they'd probably never come up with that exact song.

But something like the rangeCheck function is what you'd get if you asked a
junior programmer "before you're going to access that datastructure make sure
your within its range". Furthermore it's a completely irrelevant part of
Android as a whole which gave Google no competitive advantage whatsoever.
