Nowhere in the article do these critics actually explain how doing an offshore
trial like this is unethical. There's no suggestion that this activity
happening on Saint Kitts is in violation of local law.

So what's the problem? Are they suggesting that US law should apply to every
other sovereign country on the planet? That US entrepreneurs should be
categorically banned from financing foreign (e.g. EU or Chinese) medical
research unless it conforms to US regulation?

The cherry on top is the epitome of lazy journalism of not contacting the Saint
Kitts and Nevis authorities and getting their take on this. I assume they
disagree that Saint Kitts and Nevis is categorically unsuitable for medical
research due to their supposedly unethical regulations.
