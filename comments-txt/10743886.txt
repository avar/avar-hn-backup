You can't read while you're driving, doing the dishes etc. There's many times
when your mind isn't all that busy but your hands or eyes are. Podcasts are
great for that.

I also find them much better for interviews and the like than text, you get a
lot of information out of the tone people use, which is lost when it's
committed to text.
