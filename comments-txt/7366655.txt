That's not an accurate description at all. Both the SR-71 and the YF-12 were
developed from the A-12, which was purely a reconnaissance aircraft: https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_A-12

The whole concept of using the "Blackbird" family of planes as interceptors was
an experimental offshoot that was quickly cancelled, the SR-71 certainly wasn't
developed as some byproduct of an interceptor, it it was the other way around,
the interceptor was a failed offshoot of the reconnaissance aircraft.
