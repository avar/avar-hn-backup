The parent comment by munificent is just making the lazy go-to excuse for US
policies that it's so big / special / whatever that everything has to be
different there.

Notice how these lazy comparisons never make any specific comparisons to other
countries that would trivially refute their claims, such as Russia having 4x
less population density than the US, but still somehow managing to have a
federally mandated parental leave.

If it were true that it's just so hard for people far removed from one another
geographically to relate to each other wouldn't it follow that the situation in
Russia would be 4x worse than the US?
