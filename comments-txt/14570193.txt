I use Emacs + mu4e with 2 GMail accounts (personal & work). AMA I guess.

I use OfflineIMAP to sync the two accounts to ~/Maildir/{work,personal}, then
mu4e-context to switch between settings for the two.

I entirely outsource actually sending the mail to a local exim4 daemon which is
configured to forward through a GMail smarthost. IMNSHO this is much better
than the recommended default configuration of making Emacs actually send the
mail, I don't have to worry about not having a network connection at the time,
or some other transitory error with a real smtpd retrying the send if needed.

You then may need a tiny hack on top of Debian's default exim configuration to
make it switch between different smtp servers / accounts depending on what
address you're sending mail from. For reasons I won't go into I send E-Mail
through a company-run SMTP server even though I then fetch work E-Mail from
GMail.
