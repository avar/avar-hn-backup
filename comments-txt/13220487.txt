Because calling malloc() & free() is expensive? That's just an implementation
detail of your reference-counting GC or malloc(). You can also just
pre-allocate memory in batches which makes allocation just changing a pointer
to some pre-allocated memory.

Many reference based GC's do that, e.g. perl. Or have I entirely misunderstood
your comment?
