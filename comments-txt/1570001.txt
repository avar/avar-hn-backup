They don't officially support it. But they just run a normal Xen setup. Setting
up any Xen OS that supports running in domU is relatively easy. There's a few
people that have already done it for FreeBSD and NetBSD.

You can try it out locally by setting up Linux and running FreeBSD in domU.
Then just transfer that image to Linode.
