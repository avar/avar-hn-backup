The topic of this thread is that if you're running a Tor exit with a limited
exit policy you'll get banned by lazy admins who presume that all Tor exit
nodes have a promiscuous exit policy.

There's theoretically nothing crazy or bad about running a Tor exit node like
that, e.g. one that only allows exits to a few sites that you yourself control.

But in practice it's bad for you because of people that think "let's just nuke
it from orbit" is responsible behavior on the Internet, even going so far as to
ban whole /24 networks.
