I genuinely don't mean to sound passive aggressive when I ask, do you know
anything about this subject or are you just guessing?

I don't know anything about it, but I can think of numerous ways to mitigate
the issues you mention. E.g.:

* Does it actually matter that the absolute value of temperature sensors is
inaccurate, or is it enough that they have good relative accuracy (do they?)

* Do you really need to tell if someone is indoors or outdoors given a large
enough sample of users in a given area? That also seems like something you
could detect with heuristics (work hours, jumps up/down in temperature).

There's a lot of ways to tease useful signals from noisy data. Is it really the
case that smart phone temperature sensors in the aggregate are useless as an
input into weather forecasting models?
