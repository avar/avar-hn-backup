They don't even need the 33% improvement. They could just add that much battery
and fake the charge rate by misinforming the user about the charge rate. I.e.
say it took 30 minutes to get from 0% to 80%, but really you went from 30% to
80%, the car just shuts down at 30%.

They already have firmware unlocked battery capacity in their currently
shipping cars, so this isn't some wild conjuncture. The margins on these
vehicles are huge, they can just decide they'd like to pay for marketing by
cutting into some of those and shipping more batteries with each vehicle.
