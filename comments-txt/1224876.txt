Ah, I don't know if magit has that feature. It's relatively easy conceptually
though.

You'd write a hook for magit that on branch change would check what buffers
were open to files within the repository and refresh their contents.

Maybe something like that exists already. I just press "r" to refresh the file
from the filesystem when editing the individual files in this case.
