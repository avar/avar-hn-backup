Forming a government is going to be especially tricky. The government collapsed
due to corruption revealed by the Panama Papers.

The previously governing parties are the Independence Party & Progressive
Party, both of whom had ministers exposed by the papers.

They don't have enough of a following to form a government on their own.

The Left-Green Movement & Pirate Party say it's out of the question to be in
government with those two.

The new Regeneration party, which is a new party which split off from the
Independence Party. They don't want a coalition with the governing parties.

Negotiations are actively under way, the Regeneration party is in a key
negotiating position.
