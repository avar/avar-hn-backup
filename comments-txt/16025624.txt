The context of this thread is whether dropping $130 at a restaurant is a
"middle-class hobby", you were replying to a comment saying that was perfectly
reasonable for someone of even limited means.

I'm not defending spending $130 at a restaurant, I can afford it and I don't, I
think it's a dumb waste of money, but I think the same of a lot of other
people's hobbies. Whether those hobbies are affordable to them if they're in
the middle class is another question, and clearly dropping $130 at a restaurant
every once in a while is.
