I don't know why the limit is 100 per day, I'm just going by the article & the
pictures in it which very clearly show a tunnel open to the ocean with no lock
system.

The photos also show a mountain going straight into the ocean, which means
raising the ship with a lock wouldn't save you any money, since you'd need an
unbroken sequence of locks going all the way to the top of the mountain.
