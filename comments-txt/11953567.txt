As I recall the terms include some phrase like "we might change the license to
be similar in spirit to the existing one" which gives FSF and anyone who
controls it in the future a lot of wiggle room.

E.g. the GPL v2 to v3 transition was enabled by that, with the introduction of
patent/"TiVo" clauses. No reason they couldn't make more drastic changes in the
future.
