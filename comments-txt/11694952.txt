A few things:

Everything not being 4:3 screens. I found it better for programming than
everything being cinematic screens.

Back when monitor manufacturers were racing to make better / higher resolution
monitors, instead of just leaving it at 1080p / 4k / whatever the current
standard good enough for movies is.

The GMail interface before it started auto-converting the textarea to HTML when
edited externally.

Console gaming when it Just Worked. Nowadays when I pop in a game it's update
this and update that, long loading times etc.

E-Mail before we lost the "text should be text and not goddamn HTML" war.
