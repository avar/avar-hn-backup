Oh that's not how I meant it. I've paid my $5 for it and downloaded it, and
that link I posted will return a 403 without the right authorization.

I posted it because I was worried that I couldn't download it with wget before
I bought it, I'm on a 3G connection through my phone and I wanted to download
it to my server so I could download it later from a more capable connection.

I sent the below E-Mail to their support address (support@louisck.net) and I'd
encourage others who bought this to send something similar do the same. I think
it's important to tell artists that this sort of distribution is appreciated:

    Thanks for making this show available in non-DRM format. I haven't
    watched it yet, but I bought it and downloaded it already.

    My friends and I have been following your work for a while, I've
    watched both your HBO TV shows and downloaded a bunch of your
    standups. But since I don't live in the US and don't want to buy DRM
    content I haven't paid you for any of this.

    However I'm happy to be able to when you offer something in this
    format. I can pay for it even if I don't live in the US, and I don't
    have to buy something like a DVD or subscribe to something like iTunes
    where I'll effectively be getting a worse service by locking the media
    I buy into some corporation's proprietary distribution platform.

    But if you keep offering things in this way in the future I'll be sure
    to pay for them.

    It's not that I'm cheap. I make a very good living, and I'm happy to
    pay for things. I just think it's unethical to pay for media when part
    of the proceeds go to conglomerates like the MPAA which are actively
    working towards reducing freedom on the Internet.
