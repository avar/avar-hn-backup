This article is about parking requirements as they pertain to zoning, i.e.
mandatory parking.

Nobody's saying that you can't patronize a business that provides free parking,
but if parking isn't mandated by zoning you'll on average pay more for the
benefit compared to someone patronizing a business without ample parking.

Removing the requirement from the zoning code allows people like you to vote
with your dollars, and people who don't care about free parking to pay lower
prices. It's a win-win.
