Sure, I'm just replying to your question of "Who do you nuke? [if you don't
know who launched a missile against you]", which it seems to me is implicitly
assuming that if someone nukes you you must nuke someone back right then and
there.

That's nobody's nuclear posture, it's just a subset of the posture of the US,
Russia, China etc.
