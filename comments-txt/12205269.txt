To me the algae vs. alumnae solution to the Fermi paradox seems appealing. I.e.
that life is common, but that intelligent life isn't.

Our sample size of one on Earth supports that. We have millions of species, but
only one has evolved higher intelligence, and there's no reason to think that
it's a successful evolutionary strategy v.s. say being a parasite.

Right, "help". I'm just going to let the history of how advanced civilizations
have treated primitive civilizations here on Earth speak for itself.
