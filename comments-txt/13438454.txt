Which, particularly for those agencies, comes about due to the most absurd of
reasons:

1. We'd treat drug using employees really seriously

2. Therefore you must not do drugs

3. Because we're so serious about this this becomes a major blackmailing
vector.

4. So we need to make really sure you're a drug user.

It's an entirely manufactured problem that could be solved overnight by them
just saying "hey, don't show up high on the job, but what you do in your own
time is your own business, and we won't pro-actively investigate it anymore
than any other citizen".
