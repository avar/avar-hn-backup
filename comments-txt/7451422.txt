I'm a happy employee, and for me the reason I'm not founding my own startup
isn't a matter of personal risk at all.

It's that now pretty much all day I can do what I like doing (programming) and
come home at the end of the day and wind down from work.

If you're starting your own company you have to worry about everything involved
in that tiny company from acquiring clients to managing staff to building the
product, if that's something you want that's fine, but it's not something I'm
particularly interested in.

I also very much enjoy working on programming problems at the scale you can
only find in bigger companies, if I were to start my own company now and it
grew like crazy at best I could get back to the level of problems I solve at
work now in 10 years or so.
