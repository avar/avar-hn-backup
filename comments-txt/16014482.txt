You don't pay Netflix to use FreeBSD, you pay them for a streaming video
service that would be indistinguishable to you if they used Linux.

I'd expect Netflix to pay enough for FreeBSD to fund things they're interested
in for running their own infrastructure. This is how free software development
works, if you have an itch you either scratch it yourself or pay someone to
scratch it.

You wouldn't want a FreeBSD that would be entirely funded by Netflix either,
because nobody would be working on anything Netflix itself didn't need, such a
system would quickly end up being useless to you.
