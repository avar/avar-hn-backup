Oh come on, this is a guy who poorly disguises a press release about a
restructuring of his finances as a letter to his daughter.

It's much more likely that Zuckerberg realizes his company is overvalued, and
that he needs to acquire a massive amount of users to make up for that gap.

Subsidizing a walled-garden version of the Internet where users can only use
Facebook in developing countries makes strategic sense for the company.

Facebook doesn't care about "free internet", they care about building their
business, and this "free basics" program makes that patently obvious. I don't
blame them or necessarily think it's a bad thing , but the propaganda
associated with it is ridiculous.
