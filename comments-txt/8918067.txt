Your observation about diminishing returns is an excellent one, but your
comparison about space exploration and movie making doesn't make much sense.

The reason these people don't argue that we shouldn't stop making movies until
we end world hunger is that (well, most of the time), the making of movies is
not funded by the government, but by the private market.

It's a one thing to to argue that we shouldn't do Y at all as a species until
we accomplish X ("we shouldn't make movies when people are starving"). It's
very different to argue that maybe the government should completely prioritize
X over Y for the purposes of allocating tax money ("let's not spend money on
space until we can feed everyone").
