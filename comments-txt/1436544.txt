The reason you'd call someone Mr. Smith in the English speaking world is
because surnames are culturally significant. Because they group entire male
lineages together.

That's not the case with patronyms, so this usage has never developed. In
Iceland you'd never use just the patronym. It's not a proper name, just an
indication of parental lineage.
