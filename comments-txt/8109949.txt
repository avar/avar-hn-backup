Almost all the libraries you deal with are in-house. Which is part of what I'm
pointing out, most of getting up to speed in any company is learning about
their domain-specific codebase, not the language they happen to be using.

You're certainly at an advantage if you know some of those things already, that
goes without saying. I'm just pointing out that many people seem to
overestimate the impact of the programming language on the overall stack.
Knowing DB workflows, distributed programming etc. is much more important than
knowing language trivia which you can mostly trivially look up.
