I don't work for Apple nor do I have any stake in them, but it can be really
frustrating when people make assumptions and conclusions about the company you
work for based on the limited information available to them as outsiders.

Do you really think that some silly advert made by the marketing department at
Apple has any relevance to whatever the reasons were for the head of CPU design
for iOS devices had for leaving?

Things might be changing for the worse inside Apple, but taking these two
datapoints and assuming that something big is going wrong in the company seems
to be a conclusion that isn't supported by the facts.
