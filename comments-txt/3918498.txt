So Motorola Mobility brought the matter to German courts, who agreed to ban
those products, but "a US court has banned Motorola from enforcing the action
until it considers the matter next week.".

How is a ban Motorola has solicited under German law under the jurisdiction of
a US court, or am I misunderstanding this?
