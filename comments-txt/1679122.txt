I've contributed many thousands of lines of code to free software projects, but
I've never had to sign some waiver, walk down to the post office and send an
inter-continental letter in the mail to go along with a patch I wrote.

I'd had have to do that if I submitted a non-trivial change to the FSF, just
finding an alternative program that I can use and fix is easier, so I've done
that instead of sending patches to them.
