Disclaimer: Am Icelandic, very generally proud of how my country punches above
its weight in sports.

Having said that it's unbelievable how a publication like The Guardian can
write an article about UEFA 2016 with claims like "smallest nation ever to
reach a major tournament", without mentioning that 2016 is the first year where
24 teams compete, instead of 16 as has been the case since 1996. Before that it
was 8 for a while, and 4 when the tournament first started in the 60s.

Iceland's been getting consistently better at football for decades now, and it
beat England last year in the tournament showing that it could play with the
big boys. But obviously if the tournament is expanded from 16 to 24 teams, an
increase of 50%, it's going to be the first year that some small team
qualifies.
