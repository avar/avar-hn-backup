For people interested in getting into diving as a sport I recommend reading
"Diver Down: Real-World SCUBA Accidents and How to Avoid Them" by "Michael
Ange" (just search on Amazon).

It contains numerous case studies of diving screwups that either ended in death
or near-death and what can be learned from them to avoid those situations.
