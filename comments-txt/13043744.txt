NPR has a recent podcast called "The No-Brainer Economic Platform" which
includes changes to the tax codes that have a unanimous approval of economists
across the political spectrum (e.g. abolishing corporate tax), but which they
show via focus groups would be impossible to present to the public:

Their other plans include things like abolishing housing and medical subsidies,
which they claim just leads to price inflation in the longer term, but which
are obvious political suicides to propose.

A text summary of the podcast is available at: http://www.npr.org/sections/

They did a follow-up episode where they hired an actor to play a politician
advocating these policies, and tried to convince focus groups of voters:

The point of these episodes was not to try to present some absolute truth about
economic policies, but rather to demonstrate that while there are certain
things experts universally or near-universally agree on, convincing voters of
these policies can be a hard sell.

E.g. they argue that eliminating mortgage tax deduction would have the
counter-intuitive long-term benefit of making houses more affordable. But when
you try to explain that to people you've lost most of them once they realize
that in the shorter term their existing mortgage would go up.
