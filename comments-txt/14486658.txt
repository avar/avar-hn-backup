On a planet that follows your advice that the line shouldn't be drawn at
outlawing tools, and instead certain usage should be made illegal, "not [..]
the mere existence or possession of the tools themselves".

I'm just taking your argument to its logical conclusion. I think that argument
makes no sense, since it clearly leads to absurd outcomes, such as being able
to purchase nukes, armed fighter jets, tanks, MRAPs, mines, chemical weapons
etc.
