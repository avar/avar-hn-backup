This implementation is freely licenced enough that the BSDs and others that
don't use Git for license reasons could use it.

It would be interesting to see an alternative implementation like this get
enough feature parity that projects like the BSDs could migrate and still be
protocol and worktree compatible so most users could continue using the GPL2
implementation.

Edit: Seems people here are unaware that the BSDs treat GPL software like
cooties, see e.g. [1]. They wouldn't start using source control that gave them
less freedom than SVN, an with CVS there's the expectation that OpenCVS might
get finished.
