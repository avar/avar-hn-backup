That's a trivial cost when we're talking about sending things to Mars. The
Curiosity rover has around 5kg of Pu-238. NASA estimates that restarting
production will cost $6M/kg[1]. The total cost of the MSL program is 2.5
billion[2]. That's $30 million out of 2.5 billion, or 1.2%.

NASA has also been buying Pu-238 from the Russians at around $1.5 million/kg
[3], which would be $7.5 million for Curiosity, or 0.3% of the cost of the
program.

I'm interested in deep-space exploration (but am no expert), and as far as I
can tell the reason the US is running out of Pu-238 has absolutely nothing to
do with cost.

It's been happening because only NASA has really wanted this, but producing it
has been the purview of the military or the DOE.

So the issue has been stuck in some bureaucratic nightmare for decades, the
only people allowed to produce Pu-238 didn't need it, and NASA couldn't simply
spend a crapload of money to pay another agency or branch of the government to
restart production due to the way money politics works, even though it was an
overall good investment.

So rather than simply restart production at a trivial cost compared to what
NASA otherwise spends, it's been easier to buy it from Russia.

As [1] shows there's now a real possibility that Pu-238 will run out, so the US
has restarted production.
