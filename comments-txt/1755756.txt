For those without *.crx for Chrome association you can launch Chrome with this
parameter:

    --load-extension=/home/avar/g/sight/

After having cloned sight.git into ~avar/g/ obviously. And as a suggestion to
the author: Getting it into the Google Chrome Extension listing would make this
even easier.

Edit: Just read http://twitter.com/tsenart/status/26366227841 that sucks,
Google.
