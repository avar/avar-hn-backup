    Preparing the public for another brilliant war
    that we can definitely afford.

I'm going to assume that by "afford" you mean monetarily. In that case how do
you know it can't be afforded?

At least the Iraq war was arguably mainly about resource acquisition , have
there been any studies about how cost-effective that resource acquisition is in
the long term?

The wars cost billions of dollars, but the invading forces now have control
over billions of dollars of oil resources as well. Has anyone done a realistic
cost analysis on how those two stack up against each other?
