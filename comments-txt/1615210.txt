I liberally sprinkle my address everywhere (here it is again, spammers:
avarab@gmail.com) and I don't have a spam problem. I get at most 2-4 messages
per week that make it through GMail's spam filters.

Those are all glaringly obvious spam though, to the point that I've begun
suspecting that they're just using me to confirm that suspected spam really is
spam.
