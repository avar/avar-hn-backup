I think most patents are silly, but isn't the system working exactly as it
should here? The patent was awarded, then it was challenged in court and
overturned for many of the reasons you cite.

If we were a lot more thorough about awarding patents wouldn't that increase
the overall cost to society to exhaustively audit patents from the outset,
instead of auditing only the small subset that's troublesome enough to be
challenged in court?
