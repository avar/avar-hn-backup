You say you understand the point but you seem to have entirely missed it, the
same problem remains.

The point of the APM limit is presumably to fairly emulate a human player, but
the APMs for humans are obviously averaged over a minute.

However, for certain things humans can initiate actions in SC2 in quick
succession that, if sustained over a greater time period, would yield a
ridiculous APM rate. Think a Terran player highlighting the barracks and
tapping "A" really fast, say with a 10ms delay, that would result in 600 APM.

Let's say a human can build 5 marines like that in quick succession. You're
going to have to allow for temporary spikes in APM to not unfairly give the
human player an advantage.

But if you do that the computer is able to really rapidly execute more complex
actions that the human can't because he's limited by the SC2 UI, whereas every
action via the API is equally difficult for the computer. E.g. moving 3
different subgroups of marines out of the way of a High Templar Storm. I doubt
any human player could select 3 different subgroups of marines from one big
group and move them out of the way in 3 different directions within the span of
60ms (10ms for each action of select/move for 3x groups).

So any "fair" APM limit really needs to be dynamic in some way, or at least
take into account the complexity of actions (say highlighting a group v.s.
tapping "A"). It's not at all obvious how to do this while retaining fairness
and not giving either the human or the computer an unfair advantage.
