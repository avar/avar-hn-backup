Right, I'm just elaborating and pointing out that this caveat only happens as
long as the offer is structured in such a way that you have a massive increase
to it at a specified time once a year.

Then if you hate your job and you're close to that specified time it's in your
interest to wait, even though the point of the policy is that Amazon would
rather that you quit.

If they just increased the offer with more granularity they wouldn't create
that conflict of interest. You'd only get more money as a function of the time
you stayed on the job, so you might as well quit right away instead of waiting
a few months for a much larger payout.
