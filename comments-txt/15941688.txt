So whenever someone says "there should be a law against that" that's something
that should count against the GPs request for examples of laws that didn't
pass?

Then "annoying children in restaurants" or something equally absurd would be
the #1 most requested law by that metric.

I was referring to laws that would actually get presented to the legislature to
vote on, which the GP is proposing as some metric, but as I'm pointing out
can't be used as such because the very fact that it's made it that far is a
function of special interests, think tanks etc.
