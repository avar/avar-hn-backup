No I meant a wetsuit. Wetsuits are completely waterproof aside from a select
few entry points where water is allowed to seep through as you first get in the
water.

The idea behind their operation is that you have a thin film of warm water
around your body, isolated by a waterproof neophrene layer. So there's: The Sea
-> neophrene -> Warm water that doesn't freely mix with the sea -> You.

That doesn't work (as deadmansshoes thought) if you're wearing normal clothes
instead of a neophrene layer. In that case the water next to your body is
constantly being replaced by new & cold water, faster than you can heat it up
to provide you with insulation.

Both wetsuit and drysuits depend on there being a layer next to your body that
you heat up. With wetsuits this is a layer of water that doesn't get swapped
out, with drysuits it's a layer of air + rubber.
