I was under the impression that Silk Road wasn't a company but a private
website run by Ross. Reading over the Wikipedia article and the indictment I
can't find any mention of it being incorporated.

Although the indictment mentions at one point that he had an employee, but he
may have been paying him privately and not as part of a corporate structure.

Does that change anything vis-a-vis the argument you're making with regards to
civil disobedience?

My reading of your comments is that a corporation doesn't have certain rights
private individuals have. That makes sense, but does your argument still hold
if Silk Road is a purely private website without any corporate structure?
