They do decoy bikes, e.g. here's a news article about a thief being caught by
police stealing a decoy bike for the second time in 6 months published just 3
days ago (in Dutch, but it Google Translates):

The problem is that the police have other stuff to do, and they might as well
be pissing in the wind with the amount of bike theft here. They could do a huge
crackdown, but that's unsustainable and after the crackdown we'll be right back
to the same theft rate.

Interestingly there was a case this year (currently going through appeals)
where a judge ruled that a man stealing a bicycle in a residential neighborhood
should be found not guilty because the police had created the circumstances of
the bike's theft:

It's unclear what that means for bicycle entrapment in general, but an article
in Parool (again, in Dutch) suggested that this may have implications for the
methods of the Amsterdam police depending on how it goes:
