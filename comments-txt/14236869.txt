The AGPL closes no such loophole. It says you must make the source available if
you distribute the output of the program itself over a network, e.g. in the
case of an open source web application. This is something the GPL itself goes
out of its way to allow (unless your output is the program itself).

So it falls squarely under distributing the program, which you didn't have
permission to do without the license itself.

Building upon it & distributing the result, but yes, this is what OSS is great
for, but unrelated to my point that you as a user can completely ignore the
license & don't have to know about it. You can just follow standard copyright
law.
