When you use "[sic]" like that it means the exact opposite of what you think it
means. It means that you're quoting something with any errors or nonstandard
presentation preserved.

That caused me to do a double take when I read that wondering whether it was
actually $1000/hr or whether you were reproducing some misquotation of that
number.

Usually people resolve the matter by writing something like this instead: "
[...] charges up to $1000/hour (yes, one thousand dollars per hour!) [...]".
