Let's run with that thought. Let's say Pakistan committed to using nukes in
retaliation for US drones shooting their citizens, what are they going to shoot
at exactly?

They're supposedly developing longer-range capability capable of hitting some
of Europe[1], but right now they might be able to hit some US military bases in
the middle-east[2].

I'm not saying Pakistan isn't corrupt, but pretending that they could simply
switch from their current US-friendly policy to a strategy that's openly
adversarial to US-interests seems to blatantly ignore the realpolitik of the
situation.
