You can't view community policy and government regulation as two unrelated
things. The aviation community has a more welcoming attitude because of
government regulation.

They know that someone's backyard airplane isn't ever going to be used
commercially without certification, and even if it were the entire world's
aviation fleet isn't going to start using that model overnight, as might happen
with some homebrew crypto and a popular new app. So the situation is entirely
unanalogous.
