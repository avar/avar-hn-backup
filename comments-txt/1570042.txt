Yeah point #1 is odd. GNU/Linux doesn't let licenses get in the way of
technical decisions. DTrace and ZFS aren't in Linux because Sun explicitly
designed their licensed to be GPL-incompatible.

Where that isn't the case nobody is seeking to replace code due to license
reasons. E.g. you don't see Linux people trying to replace X11 or Sendmail
because of their licenses. But the BSD systems are actively trying to phase out
GPL licensed code due to not liking the license.
