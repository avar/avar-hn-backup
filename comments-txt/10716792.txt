Generally speaking regulators aren't actively testing that consumer products
meet regulation. The way it works is that the government sets standards that
should be met by industry, and then the industry takes care of meeting those
standards. If they don't and they get found out they're in big legal &
financial trouble, which is what's happening with VW now.
