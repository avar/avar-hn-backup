I don't understand why lack of space above ground is a hindrance to building
new ventilation shafts. Surely these aren't going to be wider than a sidewalk,
and in central London the distance between any two roads on a block is rarely
more than 50-100 meters.

You'd end up with lots of ventilation grates on the sidewalks on the surface,
but that seems like an easy and space efficient solution.
