I'm no fan of Slack, but it has IRC and XMPP gateways. You can trivially set up
an IRC bot that logs your channels & conversations, I connect to Slack via
irssi & use its standard logging facility.

So you're no more likely to lose your logs via Slack than via IRC or XMPP if
you set things up correctly.
