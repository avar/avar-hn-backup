The UK has an entirely different governmental structure than the EU, so
comparing why someone votes for an MEP v.s. UK MP makes no sense.

Of course MEPs are going to need to consider the EU as a whole, because in
order to advance the goals of their constituencies they need to cooperate with
the MEPs representing everyone else (and other EU institutions).

But expecting that you can ban MEPs from being a product of national politics
or national political branding would be folly and undemocratic. That's what the
EP is for, it's there to represent voting blocks within the nation-states that
make up the EU, MEPs are explicitly not voted for across national boundaries.

Targeting MEPs to solve a perceived "democratic deficit" in the EU seems
bizarre. They're the only directly elected institution, and they're the most
locally accountable EU representatives or institution.

It seems to me what you'd like to accomplish here would be better solved by
making the 28 members of the Commission directly elected across national
boundaries by the entirety of EU citizens.
