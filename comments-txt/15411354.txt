Yes legally it can't, but enforcing this on an open border with a direct road
connection to the rest of the EU is going to be quite interesting.

Right now this situation exists in theory, but in practice pretty much nobody
in the EU has any cause to try to import something via Norway, since its trade
deals are quite similar to what the EU itself has.

But the EU has huge tariffs on some Chinese products, including slapping China
with 30-70% tariffs on basic metal alloys in some cases[1][2].

The difference can be so large that it becomes beneficial for you as a private
EU citizen to drive up to Norway yourself to fetch e.g. basic alloys at lower
prices.

Nothing remotely like this situation exists within the land borders of Schengen
today. There's the agreement with Iceland, but as it's an island enforcement is
much easier.
