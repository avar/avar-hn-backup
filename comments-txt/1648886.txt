If you're talking about [1] then I'm one of the people who down-voted it
yesterday, for the reasons that steveklabnik [2] cites.

It's just an assertion with nothing backing it up, so it's not contributing
anything to the discussion. It's an assertion that I happen to agree with in
large part for my own reasons. But as long as you're not making a case for it
it's just noise that deserves to be down-voted, while comments that back up
their assertions and stimulate thoughtful argument deserve an up-vote.
