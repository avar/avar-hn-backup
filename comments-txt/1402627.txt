Yeah, that's unportable. Although I'm not aware of any system where it doesn't
work.

For the record, regarding 0 in pointer context the C standard has this to say:

       An integral constant expression with the value 0, or such an
    expression cast to type void * , is called a null pointer constant.  If
    a null pointer constant is assigned to or compared for equality to a
    pointer, the constant is converted to a pointer of that type.  Such a
    pointer, called a null pointer, is guaranteed to compare unequal to a
    pointer to any object or function.

    -- C89/C90 section 3.2.2.3 Pointers

The standard then goes on to say that NULL is a macro that's guaranteed to
expand to a null pointer constant.
