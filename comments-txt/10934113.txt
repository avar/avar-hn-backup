This is all correct, to expand a bit on it here's a spreadsheet someone posted
in /r/spacex analyzing the cost benefits of reusability:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/144Y_OVmFFYTh_zTiV-FH...

"Reusing the first stage three times halves the overall cost of launch. Reusing
9 times cuts the cost to 1/3. However, there is little benefit to first stage
reuse beyond thatâ€¦ Reusing both stages just once halves the total cost of
launch. In addition, reusing both stages four times reduces the cost to 1/4,
and reusing eight times reduces to 1/8."

As you touched upon a lot of things in space are expensive because launch
vehicles aren't reusable, once they are it makes sense to create cheaper and
expandable payloads rather than multi-billion dollar payloads strapped to
rockets that can't be allowed to fail.
