Start with this thread[1] from HN a couple of months ago (search for "inert").
This has been a long time coming[2] and is in response to TWA 800 which was a
747 that exploded in 1996 due to lack of fuel tank inerting[3].

The FAA issued a directive in 2008 saying that by December 26, 2017 (not 2018,
sorry) [4] passenger planes flying within or into the US had to have fuel tank
inerting. Many operators such as Delta and United (can't find a better source
for that now than this reddit comment [5]) decided not to retrofit and flew
their 747s pretty much right up to the deadline.

Other operators, such as BA (presumably) have already retrofitted their 747s
and will continue flying them.

So obviously Delta and United weren't very interested in flying the 747s anyway
since they consider it more economical to turn them into beer cans or cargo
planes than continue flying them, but the immediate reason they're stopping at
this time is because they couldn't legally continue past the deadline.

Which is all I'm pointing out here, that they've known this was coming since
2008 but didn't value the safety of their passengers enough to retrofit the
planes, and continued flying them right up to the deadline.

It's worth calling out corporate doublespeak and convenient omissions whenever
they occur.
