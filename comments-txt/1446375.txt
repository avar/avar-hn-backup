Here's a plan on the Rakudo GitHub wiki for what's going into the release:
http://wiki.github.com/rakudo/rakudo/whats-going-into-rakudo

And here's the number of tests it's passing now: http://rakudo.org/status

Rakudo's still slow and doesn't have a lot of modules written for it, but this
release is meant to address that by getting more users. It's considered good
enough at this point to write normal programs in it.
