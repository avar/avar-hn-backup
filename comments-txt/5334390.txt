Why do you think a hamburger making machine is a bad thing? Automation in the
long term is good for the economy, if it wasn't for automation those same
teenagers would be manually plowing fields instead of flipping burgers.

If anything raising the minimum wage a bit should spur a lot of automation
industries, and those same teenagers would be more likely to get an entry level
job there, instead of at a menial job.
