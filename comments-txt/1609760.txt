Yes there is, think about it :)

Bank of America has a CA signed cert, so when you go there you display a golden
"YOU ARE SECURE, CITIZEN" banner at the top with a lock icon etc.

But if someone doesn't have a CA signed SSL cert you treat it no differently
than normal HTTP traffic.

Then you train users not to submit their financial information to sites that
don't have a CA signed SSL certificate (as indicated by the giant "YOU ARE
SECURE, CITIZEN" banner).

You have to do that anyway, when I go do my online banking I visit a plain http
site and then click on my private banking link that takes me to a https site.

The easiest way for a MitM to spoof that would be to just direct the user to a
plain HTTP site when he goes to do his private banking. So even today users
have to understand that they must submit this sort of data over SSL and that
the cert involved has to be CA-signed.
