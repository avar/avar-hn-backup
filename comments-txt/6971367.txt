They do apply, just because there's fewer women than men doesn't mean they're
on the supply side.

In traditional Indian culture daughters are seen as a deprecating asset that
their parents want to get rid of.

Presumably the bribes dished out to get rid of them are less than their upkeep
would cost if they weren't married off, with some added cost to account for the
social stigma of having an unmarried single daughter.
