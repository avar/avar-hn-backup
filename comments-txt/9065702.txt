Of course you can't run "git pull --i-really-want-everything", you're the
remote attacker this feature is meant to protect against!

The use-case for this is that you're pushing to some shared hosting like GitHub
where you can overwrite and delete refs, but you can't force a gc.

You don't want someone to scour your Git commit announcements and see "oops,
deleted password!" and go and fetch the deleted SHA1.
