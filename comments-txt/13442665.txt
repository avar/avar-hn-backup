An argument from personal incredulity is still a logical fallacy. It's easy to
see why this line of reasoning doesn't make sense.

If we're living in a simulation the thing most likely to running the simulation
is ourselves, in the future.

It's easy to see why that would be valuable, e.g. this could be a simulation to
see what happens if a war broke out in 1914, and all the downstream effects on
that happening.
