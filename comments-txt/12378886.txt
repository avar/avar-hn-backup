    > existing law is changed

Like every law that's ever been passed has done?

    > previous rules that governments are
    > able to govern their state are overruled

Like every international agreement that's ever been signed? All of whom give up
some state sovereignty.

    > Court systems and existing law are overruled.

I wouldn't say "overruled", at this point the state has agreed to cede certain
matters to an international tribunal as part of the trade agreement.

So you could say "overruled", you could also say "the parties involved
voluntarily decided to change the process". Which doesn't sound that scary,
does it?

    > This is no market solution (the strongest wins)

If the strongest was really winning to the detriment of everyone else they
could just stop participating in the trade agreement.

    > This is extortion and the loss of the rule of law.

So the rule of law can only exist on the national level, and can't be enforced
by an international body that nation-states have agreed to enact? To me that
sounds very much like how courts are enacted by states, which most people
consider part of the rule of law.
