You can easily install bash on your BSD. But I get your point about writing
POSIX compatible code.

I'll declare a bash dependency in the shebang if I've only tested the script on
bash. Requiring bash is better than having the script fail on some non-POSIX
thing that I wasn't aware of.

Linux distributions are getting a lot better in this department these days
though, with dash being the default Debian/Ubuntu shell.
