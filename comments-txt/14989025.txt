Because when the cops measure your speed they can do so in an arbitrarily small
time period of their choosing, and inertia and power requirements mean you
can't be going 1000 MPH one milliseconds and 10 MPH the next.

You could decide to measure APM by saying that the time difference between any
two actions extrapolated to sustaining that rate over a minute or seconds
couldn't exceed the APM or APS, but as I've explained such a measurement would
unfairly give the human player an advantage because humans are capable of
bursts they couldn't sustain over longer periods.
