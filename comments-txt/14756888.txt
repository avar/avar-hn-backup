Radiolab did an episode recently[1] which disagrees with that Bloomberg
article.

They interview ex-Secretary of Defense William Perry asking him what controls
there are, if any, on a crazy president just willy-nilly deciding to nuke
something.

He says there's absolutely none, even if the president is in a room full of
people who vehemently disagree with him he alone makes the call to launch.
