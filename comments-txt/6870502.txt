What I'm pointing out really has nothing to do with libertarianism, for what
it's worth it's not a political position that I personally adhere to.

I'm pointing out that whatever your political leaning you don't "just" get the
government involved. Even if you think you should have a larger government than
you have now the question is what kind of larger government, and once you make
the wrong choice there's a huge inertia in the system that makes correcting
that choice very hard.

So even people that agree that government should do more aren't easily brought
on the bandwagon of the something the government wants to do being the right
version of that "more".
