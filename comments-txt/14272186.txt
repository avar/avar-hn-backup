I misphrased that, I shouldn't have said defense but when a defendant could
expect leniency on that basis.

With that caveat my question still stands, `gotothedoctor` is , if I understand
him correctly, saying that corporations like Uber can't expect that sort of
leniency, but what about other not-quite-just-a-person entities?
