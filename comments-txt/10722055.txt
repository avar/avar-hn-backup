I think you're missing how this can be a really good thing. Right now this is
happening but the "algorithm" is some unpredictable twenty year old in uniform.

Are we going to have hearings auditing what the algorithm is like? is there
going to be a scandal because isBrownPerson() is discovered in there somewhere?
Is someone going to run it against a video collection of regular daily life and
discover the drones would be indiscriminately bombing innocent situations if
given the chance?

The end result is that we're going to have to effectively have to come up with
rules of engagement for every scenario. I think this will lead to war being
fought more justly and with less collateral damage than ever before.
