Yes. All our main backend code is in Perl. There's frontend tasks in JavaScript
and some C and Python around, but my rough guess would be that less than 1% of
our code falls under that umbrella.

We're hiring, and not just "Perl guy[s]". We hire good programmers, some of
them know Perl already, but others pick it up while on the job.

Contact me at avarab@gmail.com if you (or anyone else here) would be interested
in exploring opportunities at Booking.com. Our current openings are listed at
booking.com/jobs.
