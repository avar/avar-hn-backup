Some projects like Git itself refuse to add editor droppings like ~ and # to
.gitignore. They consider the .gitignore file to be only for things that the
build system produces, e.g. *.o and binaries.

If you want to ignore things that your editor adds you should add it in .git/
info/excludes, not .gitignore.
