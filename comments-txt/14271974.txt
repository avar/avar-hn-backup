Right, but let's say for example that some guy X publishes embarrassing
classified information on a protest sign that he's holding in front of the
White House, this could be construed as civil disobedience, right?

But it couldn't if Google had the same information and published it on its
front page, since it's a corporation.

1. But what if guy X publishes it on his personal blog?

2. What if he occasionally sells used goods via his blog?

3. What if the main point of the blog is to sell those used goods, with a small
"notes from the author" section where the information is published?

4. What if it's purely a commercial enterprise & isn't incorporated?

5. And then if it's incorporated it should be clear-cut, since as you said
"only people [and not corporations] engage in civil disobedience".

My question is when civil disobedience stops being a defense. Your original
comment points out that Uber can't use that because it falls into #5, but then
you're saying it wouldn't apply to Silk Road either which as far as I can tell
falls into #4.

How about #1-3?
