Even in that situation there's an element of avoidable "own risk" that could be
priced into the premiums. Someone whose parked car gets hit by a drunk driver
is more likely to:

- Not park their car in a garage overnight, exposing them to various damage to
the car.

- Not park their car in a garage when they go downtown.

- Park their car near bars or other places statistically more likely to have
drunk drivers around.

I'm not saying your friend did any of that and that it wasn't a complete freak
accident, but on the scale of everyone that's being insured there's surely
correlations like that that justify the premiums going up.
