Really? The best description? By that definition pretty much anyone in politics
is an activist.

I think it's much more accurate to describe Ã“LG as a literal constitutionalist.

He read the letter of the law and followed its mandate.

He's undoubtedly upset the established older. I'm just objecting to how that
gets framed, which you can just as easily frame his actions as "nobody serving
as president before him had actually read the constitution" as "he's using
unprecedented powers as president".
