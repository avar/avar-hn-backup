I actually found it difficult to pick something that better described this
phenomena.

These are obviously people whose compassion for animals is a function of their
cuteness. I don't see them organizing lynch mobs for similar but much more
inhumane acts against farm animals happening in their own communities. Would
people care if this was a litter of pigs? Or a litter of rats?

And leaving aside this specific example, most people on this planet in rural
communities don't have the economic means to employ a dedicated medical
professional to put down their excess cats and dogs.

For those people drowning the animals is a perfectly legitimate option, it sure
beats watching them starve to death.

Ignoring all of this and going straight to "oh those poor puppies, what a
horrible person" as most people seem to respond is, I think, a privileged
western viewpoint.
