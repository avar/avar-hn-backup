I think it's a bit odd thinking of programming languages as a career option. I
work at what's one of the biggest if not the biggest single employer of Perl
programmers (Booking.com), and we don't specifically hire people with prior
Perl experience. We hire people with relevant programming experience and bring
them up to speed on Perl.

Anecdotally we've hired people who've had years of Perl experience who haven't
done all that well, and people who've had no prior Perl experience who've just
picked it up on the job and been very productive contributors within days or
weeks.

The unstated assumption with articles like these is that you'd be losing out if
you don't get experience with the "winning" platform, but in my opinion a much
better way to become a good programmer is to get experience with a wide
selection of toolsets and programming languages. Even if none of those toolsets
are widely used commercially.

Having said that if you're interested in Perl as a career choice we're always
hiring :)
