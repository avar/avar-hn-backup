There's no such generally agreed-upon definition of what constitutes
speculation and investing[1][2][3]. The most common use of the word
"speculation" just seems to mean "high-risk investment", but what constitutes
"high-risk" is a matter of taste.

If it ends up replacing all money then the value of a single bitcoin will be
around $200B, but I'd happily characterize that claim as speculation :)
