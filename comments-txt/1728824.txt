Regarding Man v.s. Wild: The entire premise of the show is false. They claim to
drop Bear Grylls in some remote location where he has to make it back to
civilization. But in reality they seem to just drive around and film him doing
stunts, see e.g.:

Worse, a lot of the behavior on that show is terrible survival behavior. E.g.
when they did the episode in Iceland Grylls at one point jumped into a water
filled ravine to make it to the other bank, and planned to dry off in some
geothermal area he could see in the distance.

Firstly there's no ravine like that in Iceland that you couldn't easily walk
around in 5-10 minutes without getting yourself wet, and secondly jumping into
freezing water in the wilderness and thinking you can dry yourself off in some
unfamiliar geothermal area you can spot in the distance is beyond stupid.

Most of the world's geothermal areas (including Iceland's) are just a
collection of steaming holes in the ground, or water either too hot or too cold
to dry off in. It's much better to stay dry than to take such a chance.

There are examples like that in virtually every episodes. E.g. Grylls climbing
down a waterfall that he could trivially have walked around.
