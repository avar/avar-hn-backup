There's some down-thread armchair speculation about why humans have two
kidneys. I found it interesting, but instead of conniving my own theory did
some searching.

The gist of it is that nobody seems to know, but the most simple explanation is
that lateral symmetry is common in general because it's more efficiently
encoded in the DNA. The organs & structures that don't come in twos are the odd
exceptions, not the other way around.
