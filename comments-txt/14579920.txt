The drivers are free and already in the kernel. I'm talking about firmware
support.

You can still use Debian on the desktop, it has all the WiFi support e.g.
Ubuntu has. It's just the installer that doesn't have parity since it's 100%
free, working around it is a bit of a hassle as I described, but a one-time
pain.
