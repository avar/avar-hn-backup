There's also a version of this up on the Debian website: http://www.debian.org/
News/2010/20100806

One very interesting thing about this release is the introduction of Debian GNU
/kFreeBSD. I've been running it in a VirtualBox, and while it has some bugs
it's also a wonderful addition to Debian. They've just recently got the
userspace ZFS tools working on a FreeBSD 8.1 kernel running a GNU userland and
a GNU C library.

We're heading for a brave new world where the kernel is just another package,
not some immutable part of the whole system.
