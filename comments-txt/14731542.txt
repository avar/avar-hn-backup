These free databases are really inaccurate in many cases compared to e.g.
Maxmind. E.g. this thinks my IP address is 100 km away near the German border,
but Maxmind's commercial DB puts me a 7 minute walk away in the center of
Amsterdam.

They're better than nothing, but be careful when relying on them for anything
you need accurate Geo-IP info for.
