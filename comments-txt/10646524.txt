Today's soccer shoe emergency is tomorrow's normal turnaround. Imagine trying
to explain to someone living in the 90s that they just have to watch this one
TV show right now.

Surely they could just walk down to their local video rental store, not that
many people really need to watch something right now!

But once something like BitTorrent & Netflix happens it becomes the new
expectation. I think something like drone delivery or delivery via autonomous
vehicles is going to similarly change the market for the delivery of physical
goods.
