I haven't given this more than a cursory look, but I love how the body message
for the commit that seemingly introduced this flaw is "No functional changes.":
https://github.com/git-mirror/nginx/commit/8a3f6ce

Found with:

    git log --full-diff --reverse release-1.3.8.. -p src/http/ngx_http_parse.c
