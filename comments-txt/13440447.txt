Thanks, I didn't do any of the math, but I should have remembered better from
this counteractive fact: You're already at 30km/s, it takes more energy to fall
into the Sun than escape the Solar System.

Even if you press the "gravity off" button at some random time during the day
the odds of you hitting anything are tiny, even if you fly towards the sun most
of the time you'll just fly right past it and be no worse off. Except for the
part where there's no oxygen and you can't breathe of course.
