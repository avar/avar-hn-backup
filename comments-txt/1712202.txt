In the Git project we target Perl 5.6 for critical code (like git add
--interactive) and Perl 5.8 for some other code (like git-svn). Those are 10
and 8 years out of date, respectively. Or the equivalent of targeting Python
1.6 and 2.0.

It can be mildly annoying sometimes to have to use 5.6 features when I usually
develop on 5.12 or newer, but Perl's policy of backwards compatibility makes
this a lot easier than it would be in Python.

Git also has some Python code that targets 2.4, making it compatible with such
an old version was relatively easy (see http://git.kernel.org/?p=git/git.git;a=
commit;h=23b093ee087e... for an example). A lot easier anyway than rewriting
and maintaining that code in C.
