I wish there was something like StarCraft, but where you can actually focus on
command. A real general wouldn't be ordering individual units around, and it's
silly that most strategy games implement things at that level.

You should just be able to give high-level commands like "build a base there",
"focus on Air-to-Ground development" etc.
