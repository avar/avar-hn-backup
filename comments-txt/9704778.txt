By all accounts GTA V on PC is a massive hit, so they do seem to be "pulling
this" on PC users too, and PC users are happily paying for it.

I also think the price is ridiculous, but it's ridiculously cheap. You play
most of these games for 40-60 hours, that's approaching $1 per hour of
entertainment. Almost nothing except books approach that, and those are usually
written by 1-3 people at most, AAA games take orders of magnitude more people
than that working on them over a period of years.

I think $60 is a steal for a good well-produced game compared to other forms of
entertainment with which they're competing, and clearly the market agrees since
consumers are buying them in droves.
