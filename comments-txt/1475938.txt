Indeed. Worse is better, and I use Linux and not Hurd because it does what I
need even if it doesn't look shiny on paper.

I'm not convinced that Hurd's translator idea is a hack, or that it's doing it
in the wrong layer.

That every program that presents FTP on my system (GNOME, KDE, lftp, Emacs/
TRAMP) has to implement its own VFS is a hack, so is having to use iptables or
another forwarder if I want to run a non-root daemon on port <1024. And that I
have to recompile and reboot if I want to enable some minor feature in the
kernel.

EDIT: The last two paragraphs are redundant because I misread rbanffy's reply,
and I oddly can't reply to his new one so I'm putting this here.
