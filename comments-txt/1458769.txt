I tried it on a 943M tarball that contains miscellaneous Git repositories and
their checked out trees that I had lying around:

    Compressor  Size  Ratio  Compression  Decompression
    gzip -9     555M  59%    2m39.840s    0m16.495s
    bzip2 -9    531M  56%    4m10.541s    1m27.720s
    xz -9       457M  48%    13m55.730s   0m53.290s
