Most of your comment is wrong. They've been discussing building a 1GW cable.
7000 times smaller than 7TW. A 7TW cable would be enough to transmit Iceland's
yearly electricity production 700 times over. It produces ~10GW per annum.

Hot water is not piped directly into the homes in Reykjavík, it's heated up
"cold" water, with artificially added sulfur. See another comment of mine here:

In Reykjavík the water you use is not recycled in any way, it's pumped into a
sewer from there into the ocean. It's definitely not pumped the >50 km back to
Nesjavellir for reprocessing.
