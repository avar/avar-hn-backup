The topic of discussion is not what's reasonable activity. Of course it's
reasonable to legally park your car outside, it's also reasonable to go rock
climbing.

We're talking about insurance. There's certain reasonable activity that exposes
you to heightened risk. Your car is at higher risk parked outside than in a
garage.

Who should assume the cost of that heightened risk? Should the insurance
company charge a person with a garage and a person without one the same
premiums? Should there be no consequences for damage that could have been
avoided by storing your car in a garage?

If the answer to those questions is "yes" you've created a moral hazard. Why
would anyone store their car in a safer location if their insurance company
will pay for any damages without their premiums going up?

To categorically say that this shouldn't be priced into insurance is to say
that some buyers of insurance with higher risk profiles should be subsidized by
those with lower risk profiles.

Now of course insurance companies are far from perfect. They have limited data
to work with and it wouldn't be cost effective to figure out whether some
individual customer had a one-off freak accident or not.

But over their entire customer base it's not an unreasonable approximation to
connect your premiums to traffic incidents you were involved in, even though
you were not at fault.

Not being at fault is not the same thing as not having exposed yourself to
heightened risk. The police deals with the former, insurance companies deal
with the latter.
