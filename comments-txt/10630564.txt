    > That probably depends on how reckless you were.

Let's assume the most generous interpretation possible. I.e. one where I'm at
no fault whatsoever by any reasonable definition and pose no future risk to
society.

My point is that most people do recognize the importance of intent and future
outcomes.

    > Results surely must play some role.

The more I think about it I don't think they should.

Why do we put people in prison at all? Revenge is not an actual reason, which
is where outcomes would matter. Future deterrence and security is a good
reason. Killing someone isn't primarily a crime against /them/, but a crime
against society made up by people who'd like to not live their lives surrounded
by likely murderers.

If that's the goal it makes no sense to say "oh he stabbed that guy, but missed
the heart by an inch, that's OK then". No it isn't.

    > if he was trying to kill you using voodoo magic

Now you're just entering the realm of the absurd. I'm talking about cases where
actual people actually want to kill you (successfully or not) and what we
should actually be doing about that. Let's stay on topic and not bring up silly
contrived scenarios.
