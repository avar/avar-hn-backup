I've done most of my hiking in Iceland, weather's very erratic, just because
it's pouring doesn't mean you need to seek shelter, it's just rain.

I found that everyone I hiked with who tried to waterproof their backpack would
end up with things soaked anyway. Frequently having to open the bag in the rain
means the insides inevitably get soaked, it's much harder to even
semi-waterproof a much larger area than having a waterproof duffel bag for the
small stuff.

Gives you a lot of flexibility too, e.g. I've crossed rivers and then just
dragged the backpack over to the other side via rope.
