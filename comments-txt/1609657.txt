> I'd rather everything use SSL

That's not going to happen as long as browsers treat the continuum of security
like this:

    BEST: Oh nice, a SSL connection with a CA signed cert
    COOL: A normal HTTP connnection
    OMGWTFBBQ: ZOMG SOMEONE HAS A SELF SIGNED SSL CERT THE
               SKY IS FALLING LET'S PRESENT 10 CLICK
               THROUGH DIALOGS BEFORE THE USER CAN OPEN
               THE BLODDY SITE

As opposed to:

    BEST: Oh nice, a SSL connection with a CA signed cert
    COOL: Oh nice, a SSL connection, but no CA signing, treat like HTTP UI-wise
    COOL: A normal HTTP connection, show the user the traffic isn't encrypted.
