I'm not sure I understand your question correctly, but photons have no mass. So
light can't pull objects towards itself.

In fact it'd to the opposite, which is why solar sails work. Radiation landing
on you propels you away from the object emitting the radiation.

The Pioneer anomaly is very interesting. But we don't have sufficient data to
determine what it is exactly. We should really send out more probes like that
to find out.
