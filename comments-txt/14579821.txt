HEADLINE: Better support for non-free firmware during installation

DESCRIPTION: Long-time Debian user here and free software supporter. One aspect
where I don't have any practical choice for free software is my non-free
iwlwifi firmware.

It's a huge PITA to install Debian like that when you don't have the fallback
of a wired network. You provide "non-free" firmware packages, but these don't
have the actual firmware! Rather they're dummy *.deb packages that expect to be
able to download the firmware from the installer, which is of course a chicken
& egg problem for WiFi firmware.

I end up having to "apt install" the relevant package on another Debian system,
copy the firmware from /lib manually, copy it to a USB drive, then manually
copy it over in the installer.

I understand that the Debian project doesn't want to distribute non-free
firmware by default, but it would be great to be able to run a supported
official shellscript to create an ISO image that's like the Stretch installer
but with selected non-free firmware available on the image.

DISTRIBUTION: Stable on my server, testing on my laptop.
