I'm pretty sure it's 30. I have an Icelandic citizenship (Iceland is one of the
30 in the EEA), and I'm working freely in one of the 27 EU countries currently.

All I had to do after I moves was to register with the local city authorities
to indicate that I had moved there, and provide documentation proving that I
had a job so that they knew they didn't have to put me on social security.

One might also make the counterpoint that while we can move between 30 states
in the EEA US citizens can move between 50 states in their union, and their
superstate comprises almost twice the surface area of the EU.
