> Is this not manufacturing?

No. Note that this whole conversation started with a car analogy, under that
analogy writing software would be designing a car, not manufacturing it. In
software manufacturing is distribution, which carries virtually no cost.

Of course making software would still have a cost.

> I prefer to exercise my freedoms [...] to sell my work.

More power to you then. Note that I never said that I agreed with Stallman.

I've was just responding to the fallacy in chc's post where he claimed that
just because consumer demand would shift towards free software, that the entire
software industry would be destroyed. That's ridiculous.

Software would still be needed, and people would still need to be educated and
compensated for writing and maintaining it. To assume that the market couldn't
come up with a way to meet the demand and that the clock would be reset to 1920
is na√Øve.
