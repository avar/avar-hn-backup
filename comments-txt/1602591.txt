I think they've actually got the long term covered. Everyone in The Enterprise
(which is all Oracle cares about anyway) is already using Java. Those people
want to buy official looking software with support contracts from someone.

They're going to be doing so for decades to come, either from Oracle itself, or
someone who's paying Oracle truckloads of licensing fees to be allowed to
publish their own Java implementation.

The only thing that could upset their subscription to money would be some
inconvenient little company that decides to make a clean-room Java
implementation that could target the same customers. This is what Google has
done.

If they can win this in court or force a settlement that pretty much guarantees
that anyone thinking of building that business model won't even bother to get
off the ground, and Oracle can keep printing money.

It's funny that you should mention COBOL. Java turning into the next COBOL
would be awesome for Oracle. IBM still makes billions selling systems to run
COBOL[1], that's more than Sun ever made off Java.
