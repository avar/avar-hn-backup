If you're concerned about either of those RHEL is not the distro for you. It
has a bunch of running processes, some of them are even written in Python! Talk
about unoptimal. Similarly it's not the smallest Linux distro by far.

I think this whole line of argument is just some misplaced nostalgia for distro
micro-optimization. It's not the mid-90s anymore. Space and CPU is cheap,
you're not going to gain anything significant by trimming down your distro.

If those things were actually important you wouldn't be using Azure in the
first place.
