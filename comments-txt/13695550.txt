You may be right. My reading of the quote I referenced "I would never act
contrary..." is that she's choosing not to act contrary to the visions she
sees.

But it could indeed be that the Heptapod language is some sort of brain virus
and any information she gets from the future she's helpless carrying out like
some automaton. See the sibling thread about a "memetic virus".

In any case, what I'm pointing out in this thread is that I think at there's no
way to make sense of the storyline of the movie, since it's internally
self-contradictory in how it treats time travel.

I don't have time to dig this up now, but there were some interviews after it
came out where it was made clear that this change was purely made to make the
movie more appealing to viewers, at the cost of internal consistency.
