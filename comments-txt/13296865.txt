I don't drink coffee, so this is not a defense of coffee, just a reply to your
comments about "acquired taste".

Your taste buds and your palate gets used to certain food, so the food you
think is delicious is largely impacted by your acquired taste.

You're really missing out a lot with food given your attitude to acquired
taste. You don't get to not have acquired taste, everyone has it, it's just a
function of the food you keep eating, usually to do with where you're from.

There's a definite plus in acquiring certain tastes, because it'll open up
whole new worlds of food & drink for you that you can't believe you previously
did without. Examples include: Spicy food, fermented food, dried beef/fish/
whatever, heavily fried foods, sweet, savory, stinky cheeses etc. etc.

Some things you really can't just try once. One good example is spicy food
(containing capsaicin). Where I grew up there was none of that at all, but as
an adult I made a concerted effort to try to wean myself on it because there
had to be something to it if so many people were eating it. Today spiciness is
one of my favorite food attributes.
