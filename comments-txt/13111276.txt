Getting rid of wasteful jobs is a good thing regardless of whether you can
handle the people who lose those jobs in the short term.

The job-saving technology will live forever, long after the people who are
temporarily displaced die. You're doing an immense amount of good for the
untold number of people who aren't even born yet.

Technology is also global, but the political problems associated with
eliminating jobs are problems on a state-by-state basis. Is it immoral to
develop a technology just because some political systems are incapable of
handling the gains in productivity, while other states are?
