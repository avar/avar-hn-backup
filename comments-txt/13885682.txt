I'm not involved in Emacs/Guile/GuileEmacs development. I just searched
emacs-devel / EmacsWiki before writing that comment.

Having said that it seems to be in a POC state, but is very slow and needs
optimization. These two wiki pages provide a decent overview: https://
www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GuileEmacs & https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/
GuileEmacsTodo

This "Preview: portable dumper," thread from November 2016 and spin-offs appear
to be the most up-to-date emacs-devel discussion on the subject: https://
lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2016-11/threa...

The older October 2015 "In support of guile-emacs" thread seems to have been
written after development mostly tapered out, discusses some work to be done,
and is a call for more development (which seems to have gone unanswered):
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2015-10/threa...

All the work on the Emacs integration appears to have been done by Robin
Templeton in early 2015 with no commit since May 2015: http://git.hcoop.net/?p=
