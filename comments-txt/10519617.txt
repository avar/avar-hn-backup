It looks like the headline technically violates the HN guidelines[1], unless we
consider "languages that are not English" to be "misleading or linkbait" :)

What might be getting lost in translation here is that in English language news
it's customary to use "says" when the quote is actually a translation, without
noting that it is. See e.g. news articles about world leaders ("Putin says Y")
that don't note that he actually said X in Russian, it was just translated into
Y.

Now I'm curious, is it customary to note that such quotes are translated in
German language news?
