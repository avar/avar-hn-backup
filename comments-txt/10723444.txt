We had similar terrorist attacks before we had drones, read what the likes of
Bin Laden said about why 9/11 happened. It's because the infidels are on their
homeland, not because they're using some specific technology to attack them.

More generally people resort to terrorism in the face of an overwhelming enemy.
The west could relatively easily win the wars they're fighting now in the
middle-east with their WWI armies if they were willing to care less about
civilian casualties, that's how lopsided the odds are.

    > "soldiers" is preposterous.

Drones as a technology would happen regardless of whether or not the armies
developing them were concerned about their own soldiers. They're simply the
logical next step in technology, e.g. fighter jet development has stalled to
some extent not because the technology has reached its limits, but because if
you pull more G's than you do now the pilots might die.
