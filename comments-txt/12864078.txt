This is because any mature rocket technology can trivially be adjusted to be a
nuclear weapons delivery platform. By assisting India you're paying for their
ICBM development.

Maybe the line shouldn't be drawn at rockets, but unless you think we should
have free & open markets for nuclear weapons I daresay you think the line
should be drawn somewhere.
