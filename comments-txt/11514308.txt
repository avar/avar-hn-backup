You'll find this old mailing list post a good answer to your question: http://
zork.net/~nick/mail/why-reiserfs-is-teh-sukc

The answer is cost. We used to have the computers you're describing. They were
made by SGI and the hardware & OS made all sorts of guarantees like the ones
you're describing, to the point where XFS was ported to Linux x86 initially it
had all sorts of bugs that simply couldn't happen on SGI machines.

The x86 boxes were cheaper, nobody really cared enough about hardware
reliability enough to pay the price for the likes of SGI, and the rest is
history. Today we have a "worse is better" hardware architecture and software
has to be able to handle it.
