There's some really interesting inconsistencies in that table. E.g. some think
tractors for fieldwork aren't OK but lawnmowers are, for others somehow
chainsaws are bad but washing machines are fine etc.

Looking these over there doesn't seem to be any clear pattern to me. The
grandparent mentioned them not wanting things that will "drastically change
their way of life", surely having a washing machine is a bigger change to your
life than having a chainsaw, even if you're a farmer.
