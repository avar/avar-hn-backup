No we know what sort of storm surges are 10, 100, 1000 year events etc. At that
point it's just a question of what you design the tunnel to withstand.

This is an elementary application of Archimedes' principle. The weight of the
ship is equivalent to the weight of the water it displaces[1].

If the ship is stuck against the ceiling of a confined space the pressure it's
excreting on the ceiling is going to be the equivalent to the displacement of
that "extra" water.

1. Leaving aside the full calculation which takes the difference in the weight
of air & water into account for the purposes of this explanation.
