The whole theory of personal liberties collapses once you consider sufficiently
powerful technology.

If there was a drug that gave the user unimaginable euphoria or was guaranteed
to kill them with a 50/50 chance should we do everything in our power to stop
that? Especially for the young and impressionable? Even as someone who thinks
heroin should be legal that gives me pause.

Should knifes for personal use be legal to purchase? How about guns? How about
artillery? Tanks? Nuclear weapons?

I don't know, but thinking about these issues in absolutes like "personal
liberties" tends to bring you some bad places, just like any other absolute. I
think it's more useful to think about the practical implications of our actions
given existing data, which shows the current drug war clearly isn't working,
but that doesn't mean we shouldn't ever have any sort of ban on substances
purely intended for personal use for public health reasons.
