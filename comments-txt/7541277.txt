With regards to point #2, do you feel the same if you put yourself into some
completely novel situation. I.e. let's say you've never been diving, you go
diving for half an hour, does it pass by in the blink of an eye or does it take
as long as you once remembered?

Is your perception of time because you're just so used to most things you do in
your daily life that you don't notice the details, or is it some innate change
in the brain as we get older?
