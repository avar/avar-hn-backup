Easy explanation for this that's probably correct:

- Your assumption that crows don't range outside the urban area is false.

- It would have only taken one crow in the group to be familiar with a gun

- That single individual recognizing it and flying off in a panic triggers the
rest to fly off, a behavior typical of herd/flock animals.
