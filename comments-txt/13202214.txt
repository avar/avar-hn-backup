Selective Availability was replaced by regional denial capabilities with the
GPS III satellites, i.e. instead of fuzzing the signal the US can now turn off
GPS for entire countries[1].

It's strategically foolish for the major economies like the EU, Russia & China
to depend on the US's goodwill in maintaining a system that drives a huge part
of their economy, GPS is used pervasively for everything, and that's only
increasing.

Trump wants NATO countries to pay their fair share, how long until he gets the
idea that all countries around the world should pay a GPS licensing fee least
GPS regional denial be turned on?

Those are the sort of reasons for why it makes sense to develop a GPS
alternative, even if you're only aiming for feature parity, or even less than
that.
