On which one does it work? I haven't run across a Linux filesystem where it
doesn't work, including mounts over NFS. But I suppose on some non-POSIX
platforms you might have more issues, or with some esoteric mount options to
screw with mtime or something.

The reason it's disabled by default is first of all that it's relatively new,
but secondly that if your FS stops behaving as expected (or you move your repo
to one that doesn't behave) it'll degrade very badly, i.e. "git status" might
now completely miss files that have been modified in your working tree.

But if you're just running a system where you know you can trust the FS you can
use the untracked cache and get a lot of "git status" speed-up, which'll matter
more the larger your checkout size is in terms of checked out directories &
files.
