When I lived in Germany I by mistake didn't check into a tram once and was
discovered by a ticket inspector. Long story short since I didn't have ID on me
I ended up getting escorted by two police officers back to my house to show
them my passport.

So yes, you don't have to carry ID on you in Germany, but only in the most
pedantic sense. You'll just get a free police escort back to where you keep
your ID in case you need to identify yourself. That hardly qualifies as not
needing to carry ID when going about your business in the sense that Americans
would be familiar with.
