Right, for direct guarantors it makes sense. But there's also occasionally news
from Japan of "Japan Rail [..] charg[ing] families of suicide victims more than
US $2 million" e.g. covered in this reddit thread:

So I can definitely see how this makes perfect sense when it comes to doing
"damage" to apartments (even if only due to reputation / superstition) if there
are direct guarantors, but as the news about JR show there must be something
deeper going on here.
