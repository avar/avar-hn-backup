French is currently unique in that it's the previous lingua franca, so much so
that the term for "world language" in English is a French term.

That French is now using loan words from English doesn't mean that it's dying.
Have you tried to speak English without French / Latin / Norse loan words? Good
luck.

It just means that French is like any other language now, aggressively
borrowing from the current world language. Nothing wrong with that.
