I looked up "Bora". No results. The Volkswagen Bora was somewhat famous in
Iceland because "Bora" means "Anus". You could drive the Volkswagen Anus! The
vendor went out of its way to mispronounce the name in their TV ads as "BÃ³ra",
which would be like pronouncing "Anus" as "Aneece" or something like that.
