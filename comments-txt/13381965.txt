Because there's no such thing as just giving you the option to use your car.
Once that option exists people will use cars, more car use requires bigger
roads, more spaced out shops due to parking, and eventually gigantic junctions
and highways.

Soon enough what used to be a 500 meter walk turns into walking 2 kilometers
because of all the car-related infrastructure in the way, which then becomes a
self-reinforcing feedback loop as more people own cars, so they're willing to
travel longer distances, reducing the business & zoning incentive to make
things walkable.
