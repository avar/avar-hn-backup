Well, you don't have to lie on your resume or on your interview but have you
considered just not mentioning it? Unless you're applying for certain types of
jobs they're not going to do a background check on you, and you're unlikely to
be under any obligation to disclose that you were convicted of computer fraud
if you're applying for a computer related job.

Also, think about taking jobs in countries that aren't the U.S.. It might be
nice to have a fresh start somewhere else, but I don't know what sort of visa
troubles you'd have with your record.
