A transaction here is a block. A block averages 2000 or so transfers, so that
$20 becomes $0.01 for any individual transfer in the block.

Electricity price in the US is also irrelevant. As the article shows just over
0% of blocks are mined in the US, or a rounding error. Bitcoin mining chases
cheap electricity.
