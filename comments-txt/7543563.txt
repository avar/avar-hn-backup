Here's a patch I submitted purely for discussion to add a feature to Git to
allow for vanity commit hashes back in 2011, it generated some interesting
discussion: http://lists-archives.com/git/756392-choosing-the-sha1-prefi...

Unlike the linked it didn't alter the commit date, but altered the Git code
itself to add a new custom header to the commit object.

Git handles custom headers just fine since it ignores unknown headers for
future compatibility. This commit still lives in the main Git repo at work
without any issues:
