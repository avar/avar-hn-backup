That's very useful. I've got it installed already.

Here's a small patch to it to make it work without your dotemacs: http://
github.com/avar/ibuffer-git/commit/59674f

And here's what I had to do to get it working with my dotemacs which uses
autoloads instead of loading everything at startup: http://github.com/avar/
dotemacs/commit/9bd611

One day I'll figure out how eproject works, and customize-variable, and
everything else I haven't looked at in Emacs yet :)
