Iceland (where I'm from originally, so I'm familiar with it) is already your
worst nightmare when it comes to this. There's a 500 page PDF[1] exhaustively
detailing every product category and what tolls & fixed fees you pay on certain
products. Ketchup 0% toll, Mayo 0% but 19 ISK per kg etc. Turn to page 50 and
you can see different tolls & fees for different types of cabbage.

It's an entirely byzantine system, but because it's happening when products are
imported, or at the point of sale, it's vastly easier for consumers than an
equivalent system that works through tax rebates.

Things on that list occasionally become a political issue. E.g. the tax on
added sugar has gone back & forth a couple of times depending on who's in
government.

Still, this adds zero complexity to your tax return, or to the average person's
interaction with the government or private businesses.
