Yes, but be careful. UIs like that tend to accumulate "--yes" options, because
you don't feel like being asked every time for 1 server. Then one day you screw
up the wildcard and it's 1000 servers, but you used the --yes template.

Which is why I'm pointing out that to design UIs like these you should fall
back on slightly different UIs depending on the severity of the operation.
