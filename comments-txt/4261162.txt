I wrote this a while ago (July last year) as http://goosegoosego.com whose
source code is available at https://gist.github.com/1113894

You missed a spot in your handling of bang syntax, DuckDuckGo allows you to use
either "\", "! " or "!ducky " to find the first result, you don't handle "\".

At the time I also sent Gabriel Weinberg an couple of E-Mails about it saying
I'd love to have it be made redundant by DuckDuckGo itself, but it's not a
feature he's interested in pursuing:

    Duly noted, but not sure about doing that. Alternatively, you can
    use the 0-click api at http://api.duckduckgo.com/, which returns
    bang redirects and then you can just do a substitution if you see
    that.

    Gabriel, http://ye.gg/

So handling stuff like !mysql is certainly something you could expand upon if
you want to make this more complete, I was just interested in making mine as
minimal as possible, so it's a simple standalone script.

Also, to anyone using DuckDuckGoog or my GooseGooseGo you should be aware that
you're trusting some (other) random dudes on the internet with your searches, I
don't log anything with GooseGooseGo (no access or error logs), but you only
have my word for that.

You can expose some sensitive information via your searches, and that's a
reason why many people use DuckDuckGo in the first place even though their
results aren't always up to par with Google's.
