Yes, if they're actually acting in the interest of public safety, e.g. if a
stray bullet meant for a dangerous gunman hits an innocent civilian.

The Chris Dorner fiasco came about because the LAPD fired on civilians they
believed to be Dorner, they were incompetent in doing so, but firing on a
suspected dangerous gunman is not a bad thing in principle.

But as far as I can tell the cops had no reason to suspect that there was any
imminent danger from these flying robots, and were firing in the air just
because they didn't like being recorded.

Firing into the air in a civilian area seems to me to be a much bigger issue
than them trying to suppress news coverage of protests.
