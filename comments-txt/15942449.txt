That request is just rhetorical grandstanding. There's no way for anyone to
know what laws would have been realistically proposed and passed if the
universe wasn't in the state that it's currently in.

If you attempted to collate such a list you'd end up with an infinite amount of
garbage, including but not limited to a proposed law that anyone suspected of
wrongdoing be beheaded.
