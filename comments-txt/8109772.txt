I quizzed my interviewers for about an hour on how Booking did things and why
when I had my interview, and I still got hired. Besides, like everyone if we
don't hire someone we don't tell them why due to liability reasons.

So if you had an interview and got rejected maybe it was for some completely
different reason, I've certainly never heard about someone getting rejected
because they asked too many questions.

You might get rejected because you don't seem like a good fit though. I
commented on this a bit more specifically in a Reddit discussion a while ago:

Anyway, it's unclear from your post whether you tried and failed at an
interview with Booking, or whether you used to work there. If it's the former
I'd be happy to help you with another try.

Like any employer we'd rather not hire one right person than hire ten people we
shouldn't have hired, so statistically we reject some candidates that would
have been good fits.
