    > I'm aware of github enterprise

Which I must say is also insanely priced, particularly since you have to pay
for everyone with a user account.

Which means if you're wanting to use GitHub issues to replace some bugtracker
the non-developers need access to you're paying full cost for everyone who
might need to update a bug once or twice a year.

I understand that they're trying to get everyone to use their online offering,
but a lot of organizations wouldn't consider it due to a combination of not
wanting to host their code externally, and GitHub's ongoing uptime issues. They
might go for GitHub Enterprise, but it's crazily priced compared to other
similar software (e.g. Atlassian Stash+Jira).
