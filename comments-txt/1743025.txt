Why do you limit a reasonable amount of time to a human lifetime? If we're
going to colonize interstellar space with anything like our current technology
we're probably going to have to ditch that requirement.

There's no reason you can't have a multi-generational ship that takes a
thousand years to arrive. You don't have to send thousands of people either,
it's enough to send a hundred or so, have them populate on the way, and maybe
send some frozen sperm & eggs with them to increase genetic diversity.

Another possibility that'll probably become viable within 50-200 years is to
not send any humans at all, but to only send a fast & small ship with human
sperm & eggs that can start hatching humans once it gets there. Raising the
infants could be done with robots and other infrastructure manufactured once we
get there.
