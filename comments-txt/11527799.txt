    > Look at the paradise that is Iraq.

Iraq was held together by a strongman of one of two secterian factions on the
country, who when the country collapsed went right back to killing each other.

I don't think any such analogous situation exists in North Korea, it would be
much more like East Germany, the economy would be horrible for decades, but I
doubt it would come to perpetual civil war like Iraq.
