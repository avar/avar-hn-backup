That's more reasonable but not the argument the article is making, which could
be paraphrased as "it's not being done the way we do it in the US, so it must
be bad".

You can't trial a drug in some supposed banana republic and then market it in
the US. Here's a nice overview of the hurdles the FDA puts on foreign-developed
drugs, even those from mature developed markets like the EU and Australia:

So the concern is not that FDA rules are being evaded for the purposes of
marketing to US consumers, but rather that someone's running preliminary
medical trials outside of the US. Presumably to test basic viability, or
perhaps to initially target markets in other countries than the US.

Herpes is already killing hundreds (if not thousands) annually, although it
seems nobody has good numbers on this as the countries disproportionately
affected are usually really poor [1][2][3].

A lot has been written about how insanely expensive medical research is these
days, and how big drug companies tend to focus on expensive drugs they can keep
selling you at the cost of something like vaccines.

It's pretty telling that we're talking about Peter Thiel funding Herpes vaccine
development at all, the fact that he's not a joke in that space being
out-competed by big pharmaceutical companies should tell you something.

So this supposed trolley problem of "if we allow cheap research people might
die" becomes less clear. People are dying right now, and apparently basic
research to solve that problem has become too expensive for anyone to bother in
major developed nations like the US and EU.
