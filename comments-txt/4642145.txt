You're asserting a lot of things without any specifics to back them up. I've
been using Linux-based systems for a long time and the quality of the kernel
has never posed any sort of practical issue for me.

If Linus had chosen a small team and taken his time to do anything I'm sure the
Linux kernel could have ended up like OpenBSD or similar systems. A very high
quality OS that takes its time to do everything to the point where users more
interested in a practical OS would have looked elsewhere.
