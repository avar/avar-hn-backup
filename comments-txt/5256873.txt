How do you think things get proposed to organizations like the IETF? Someone
comes up with a working implementation, proves it to work & to be better than
the existing stuff, and then they propose it for inclusion.

That's what Google is doing, and they're using Google Chrome as their test bed
(along presumably, with a bunch of non-Chrome stuff internally).

This is the same thing they did with SPDY. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
SPDY#Relation_to_HTTP for details.

If what you're hinting at is that they should first start some wider discussion
about what a next-gen UDP should look like before they start doing anything,
then I suggest you look up "bikeshedding". Such a process would never get
anywhere.
