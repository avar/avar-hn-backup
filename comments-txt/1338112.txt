The phrase "Perl holds the internet together" was coined by analogy with Perl's
widespread use as a glue language. You've interpreted it too literally. It
doesn't mean that you can't set up a router or another piece of Internet
infrastructure without using Perl.

It means that Perl is used in a lot of unexpected places, and that a lot of
critical things are "held together" by Perl. Even if you think your website is
running on Java, some systems administrator probably has a cronjob written in
Perl critical to its operation.
