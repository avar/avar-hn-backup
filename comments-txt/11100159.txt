Nowadays the only thing I use outside of Emacs is GNOME Terminal / Google
Chrome / bash / screen / ssh. All the rest (including E-Mail) is inside Emacs.

The Emacs/Vim war is a bit silly, because historically they're really not
comparable in that way (although vim has gotten larger). Emacs is more of an
alternative to GNOME/KDE/Windows/OSX than it is an alternative text editor.
