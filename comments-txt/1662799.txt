So they're self-critical when speaking to western media? That could just be a
PR move and have nothing to do with their actual motivations. Is there anything
to suggest that they're actually trying to increase personal freedoms?

If anything it seems that they're just continuing business as usual, with The
Great Firewall and other similar efforts. But I'm not very familiar with
China's politics.
