Being for or against policy because of the "message" it sends has historically
been a pretty bad idea.

Just look at the drug war, where we don't want to send the "message" to kids
that drugs are OK.

There's no telling what incentives people will actually have once BI is
implemented. Maybe they'll actually be more incentivised to seek risky and
rewarding work because they have a guaranteed safety net.
