I'm a developer and I never use the ins/home/pgup/del/end/pgdn keys. I use the
equivalent readline and Emacs keybindings for those.

I develop on Debian running on a MacBook Pro. Sometimes the screen size bothers
me, but the laptop being bigger would probably inconvenience me more.

I might be an unusual case, but perhaps what you imagine the market for
developers to be isn't the actual market for developers.
