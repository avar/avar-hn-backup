The entire point of these deals is that some random US company in some random
US state shouldn't have to worry about dealing with some random EU company in
some random EU country, for any value of state/country for the two. There
should be unified standards.

Saying that you should just let the free market handle it is the libertarian
idea that now every company needs to have expertise in international politics
in order to invest or do business, as opposed to just having a well regulated
market.

Which doesn't mean that those courts are compatible in their decisions, or
would treat foreigners fairly, which is what the ISDS addresses.

    > Another market solution is insurance.

I.e. wasted capital because of uncertainty incurred by a lack of free trade
guarantees, something a free trade agreement would address. We could just not
waste that capital to begin with.

The entire point of a free trade agreement is to remove those hurdles where you
don't have to buy insurance or hedge your bets just to sell something to
another country.
