I was actually aware of that. I've just been inspired by GitHub to use the word
"fork" in a more inclusive manner.

Anyway, it really doesn't really matter who maintains the the fork. The
important part is that with Open Source anyone can create one.

If your fork is better it'll become the canonical version. Just look at what
happened with XFree86 and X.Org.
