Liability of all things is "The. Critical. Question." when it comes to
autonomous vehicles?

That's such an amazingly American thing to say. Do you really think that the
uptake of autonomous vehicles is going to be hindered to any significant degree
by what are largely U.S.-specific legal issues?

Can you imagine a world in 2060 where the U.S. decides to leave something like
10-20% of GDP on the table because of the liability aspects of their legal
environment? It might hinder uptake a bit but I don't see it stopping it in the
long run.

In any case regardless of what the U.S. does at that time the rest of the world
is going to be driving autonomous vehicles.
