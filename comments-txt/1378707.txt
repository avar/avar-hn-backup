Perl already has a large standard library, it's called the CPAN. Unlike say
Python the aim of Perl's standard libraries isn't to give you a good
stand-alone programming environment, it's rather to bootstrap the CPAN
toolchain so that you can install these libraries.

Perl has numerous web libraries on the CPAN (Catalyst, Mojo, Dancer etc.), and
if you don't like the bare-bones object system you should look at Moose.
