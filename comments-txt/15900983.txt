People including yourself have been missing the point with Nintendo's raw
performance for decades now. The Xbox, Playstation and Switch are all using
off-the-shelf components, the days of console companies developing custom
hardware really ended in the 90s, at best the early 2000s (PS3).

This means that today the fact that Nintendo has a slower console is purely a
pricing and strategic decision, not some lack of ability to execute. Nintendo
knows that when they release a console they might get some AAA games released
on it in the first couple of years, but after that devs of AAA will leave it
behind for more powerful consoles.

They're fine with that, if you want AAA games you buy an Xbox or a PlayStation.
Nintendo's comfortable in their market segment. They're willing to ignore the
AAA market to bring their costs down.

There's a name for the 3rd console that tried to compete on performance with
the big boys, the Dreamcast.
