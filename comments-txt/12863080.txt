The referendum to enter the EU had a 64% turnout with 67.23% voting yes &
32.77% voting no. So that's around 43% that voted to enter[1].

Regardless, I think this entire line of reasoning makes no sense. You could
dismiss pretty much any election by multiplying the "yes" votes with voter
turnout to get less than 50%.

That's just how democracies work, if you don't care enough to vote you don't
get a say, that doesn't mean the opinions of people who do turn up should be
given less weight.
