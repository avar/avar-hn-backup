An interesting detail left out of the article is that Norway's neighbor Iceland
ended up signing a free-trade agreement with China in 2013, both Norway and
Iceland had negotiations underway in 2010 when China broke ties with Norway.

Norway and Iceland are both EEA members, effectively with one foot in the EU,
Iceland was the first European country to sign such an agreement with China.

Norway and Iceland having free-trade with China while having deep access to the
European single market leaves EU expansion in an odd situation. Neither country
could become a full EU member without hurting trade with China, or
alternatively the EU would have to make a similar FTA with China beforehand.

I've wondered what the realpolitik of the situation is. Is China's main
interest in these deals to drive a wedge into further EU integration? Are they
trying to create a situation where Norway and Iceland joining the EU would be
contingent on the EU accepting a FTA with China?
