Amazon doesn't do this, and ship their own store. What do you think would
happen if Samsung forked Android and didn't ship the Play Store? Now app
developers would just upload their apps to both stores and Google's power over
Android as a whole would be entirely eroded.

So no, they definitely don't get to boss the OEMs around. Unlike Microsoft with
Windows they don't get to just say "you can't ship Windows^HAndroid anymore".

They do have a bit of hold over the OEMs in the form of it being a PITA to
fork, access to Google's own apps etc. So I'm not saying they have no leverage,
but it's a lot less than what Microsoft has, and definitely not enough to say
"my way or the highway".
