It's extremely amusing to see someone nostalgically complain about huge JS
assets, when every subpage on that site has a 56K *.gif image as a <body
background="">[1], i.e. something that would have taken a full second to
download on a 56K connection. Just like 1MB of JS takes about a second to
download & render on your current >1MB/s connection.

Back in the day people used to complain about these huge background images just
as much as purists today complain about >1MB JS/CSS assets, which given Moore's
law & the increase in network speeds works out to be the same thing, relatively
speaking.
