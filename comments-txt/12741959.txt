    > What happens if US and Russian relations break down?

Isn't it literally the case that if the US wanted to send people into space on
their own hardware they could do it with months of lead time with the Falcon 9,
Delta IV etc.?

Those rockets aren't "human rated", but are they (particularly the Delta IV)
any less safe then the Soyuz or Chinese rockets?

I.e. this seems more of a "we have some rockets, but it's cheaper to launch
with the Russians" rather than "we can't do it" problem to me.
