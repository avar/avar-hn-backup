You turn left by getting in front of the row of stopped cars, e.g. [1] in
Amsterdam shows such an intersection.

This is a common pattern in The Netherlands, and the one I personally prefer to
what you describe, since aside from a full roundabout it offers the best
trade-off between safety and commute speed while on a bicycle.

Granted, my experience of The Netherlands is biased towards central Amsterdam,
since it's the only place I've lived, but there's plenty of places there where
car & bicycle traffic is mixed. It seems fine to me to mix car & bicycle
traffic as long as you force the road speed down, or ensure that the bicycles
have priority e.g. on left turns.
