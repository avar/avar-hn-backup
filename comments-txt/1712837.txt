I should have said: They haven't been fixed by default.

Perl is also moving forward, it's just doing so differently than Python. Python
has major releases like 2.6 and 3.0 where they explicitly break old code in the
default installation.

Perl however doesn't break any of the old warts by default, but developers can
easily do so by importing modules like Moose and perl5i in their own code. See
http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Moose and http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?perl5i

Perl's model means that you can usually upgrade any code base from say 5.6 to
5.12 without major headaches. But if you try to do the equivalent with Python
1.6 to 3.0 you'll run into trouble.

There are advantages to both models, but with Perl's you rarely see users with
big legacy code bases staying behind on some legacy 10 year old release of Perl
that may have bugs and security issues. Users usually just upgrade along with
their OS without any major pains.
