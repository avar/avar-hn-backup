I'm not from the US and I don't have a lot of knowledge about US law, but it
seems strange to me that the executive branch of the government is hosting
petitions for what in most other countries would fall under the legislature.

Isn't it the task of Congress in the US to set policy about what requirements
are attached to the expenditure of public money, does the executive branch
really have any impact on stuff like this?
