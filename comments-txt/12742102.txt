Yeah I've been quite interested in it an other conspiracy theories, like the 9/
11 conspiracy theory (also bunk) etc.

Most of what these conspiracy theories consist of is just anomaly hunting, you
take a really complex event and try to find any sort of unusual things, which
of course you're going to find since it's a big & complex event.

Check out this interview (around 40m) in [1] with Gerald Posner, the author of
Case Closed[2] (a non-conspiracy Kennedy assassination book) for a good start
down the rabbit hole of non-conspiracy coverage of the Kennedy assassination.
