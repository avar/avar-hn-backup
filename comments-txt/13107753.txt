The parent is putting Barcelona in an unfairly positive light here. Its
supermarkets are fantastic, but Spain has a dismal unemployment rate, which is
one reason for why you get such good service at their supermarkets.

It really drives wages down, so they're overstaffed compared to other
countries, and instead of it being an entry-level job for teenagers the norm is
to have them staffed by 30-60 year olds with lots of experience, but likely few
other options when it comes to employment.

So does putting people who work at grocery stores ultimately help things? I'd
like to think so, technology advancement is our only hope of getting rid of
most menial jobs. Those who rail against it rarely do so with any sensitivity
to all the menial jobs we've gotten rid of already, for the good of all.
