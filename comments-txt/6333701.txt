Sure. It's going to get better. But it's still 1.5h per day spent on the
equivalent of a gas station. If you wanted to stop for sightseeing while on the
road in a gasoline powered car you'd likely take 10 minutes or so to fill up
for the whole day, and then stop somewhere more interesting.

I'm just saying that it's disingenuous marketing speak by Elon Musk to try to
pass of a 1.5 hr mandatory stop at a place you wouldn't have stopped at unless
you needed to as "stopping anyway".
