These recent moves aren't making me trust Microsoft anymore than before.

It's fantastic that they're open sourcing some stuff these days, but the things
they're open sourcing and external projects they're contributing to are all
either cost centers (nobody makes money on browser engines these days), or
areas where they've lost the battle for cloud hosting, and are hoping to get a
leg in on Linux-based hosting.

Now if they were to open source something like MSSQL, Exchange server, truly
open up the office format, or pretty much anything where they haven't utterly
been defeated by existing open source products I'd be impressed and might think
their company culture is truly changing.

As it stands I don't see any reason to think that this isn't just all part of
an experimental marketing strategy to bring already lost markets back under the
Microsoft umbrella, and once they can achieve lock-in again; goodbye open
source.
