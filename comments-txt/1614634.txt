Does Michigan have worse weather than Bergen? The wettest city in Norway,
situated 6Â° south of the Arctic circle? I'm willing to bet not.

Bergen has seen a boom in percentage of trips made by bike since they
instituted a program to make the city more friendly to that mode of
transportation.

Cities being designed around the automobile are by far the biggest thing
standing in the way of the uptake of everyday cycling, not the weather.
