"Half the world is cracking up in laughter. The United States doesn’t just
interfere in elections. It overthrows governments it doesn’t like, institutes
military dictatorships. Simply in the case of Russia alone—it’s the least of
it—the U.S. government, under Clinton, intervened quite blatantly and openly,
then tried to conceal it, to get their man Yeltsin in, in all sorts of ways.
So, this, as I say, it’s considered—it’s turning the United States, again, into
a laughingstock in the world." --Noam Chomsky[1].
