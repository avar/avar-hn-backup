The single biggest contributor is probably GDP per capita. You don't have the
same economic pressures for efficiency and infrastructure if you can replace
them with cheap labor, and without a high GDP you won't have the money to
invest in all this infrastructure.

Both of those are chicken & egg problems to some extent.
