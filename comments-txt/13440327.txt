If you can block gravity you can achieve orbit at walking speeds if you turn of
your anti-gravity machine some tiny fraction of the time you're spending in
orbit.

Similarly with going outside the solar system, you could just jump on the
planet Earth and press the "anti-grav" button, and in a few hundred thousand
years you'd be outside the solar system.
