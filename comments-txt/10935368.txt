Between this and the ChakraCore news item on the front page I've been wondering
whether Microsoft really has been changed its behavior since the 90s, or
whether this is just how they play the game when they're not in a position of
strength as they are with node.js and cloud services.

It's pretty telling from the ChakraCore thread not entirely being "They're
obviously trying to embrace, extend, extinguish node.js like they did Java"
that people have either forgotten their modus operandi, or that I'm too much of
a cynic and they've genuinely changed.

Sometimes I think I'm being too cynical and they're now just as "nice" as some
other companies which have a mostly healthy relationship with open source &
open architectures.

But then again all the news where they're being more open these days have to do
with areas where they don't have established lock-in, including projects like
.Net & ChakraCore which formed the basis of some of the major projects where
they lost the lock-in wars.

Are they just trying to lure users they've lost back into their sphere of
influence so they can tighten the noose again, or are they genuinely doing
business differently now?

I don't know, but it's hard to place any trust in them when you've been burned
so many times, and even though they have a new CEO middle management & their
business model has a lot of inertia.
