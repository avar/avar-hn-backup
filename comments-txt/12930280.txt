You don't need to scale up solar or wind in a particular region, you just
transfer it from afar via HVDC. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desertec

Sure there's engineering challenges in that, but no more than some hypothetical
case where we need an entire fusion plant in some locality right now.
