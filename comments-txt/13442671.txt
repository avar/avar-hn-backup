Singapore is doing it because the alternative would be to use much more of
their tiny island for car-related infrastructure. The total cost of that
infrastructure would be much higher than what the sum of the COE's[1] would
cost.

Are you sure Singapore is artificially inflating the cost, or that where you
live isn't artificially subsidizing the cost of car ownership?
