It's not. I was talking about Perl6::Gather, Perl6::Junction etc.: "pretty much
anything except smart match [...], Class::MOP and Moose falls under the ...
underused".

So Moose is not underused. But some of the other modules that draegtun cited
are. It's disingenuous to cite some crazy module Damian wrote that nobody uses
as an example of Perl 6 features in Perl 5.
