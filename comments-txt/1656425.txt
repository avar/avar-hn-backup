Well there's still plenty of uses for a fast and helicopter. Patrol missions
for one. But hopefully they'll be able to scale this up to bigger sizes.

Does anyone know if that would be much harder? I.e. is it inherently harder to
make heavier helicopters go faster? Or do you just have to scale up the
fabrication.
