They probably aren't, but they aren't going to be using the infrastructure in
the pathological way CocoaPods is either, which requires you to have a client
that uses GitHub on behalf of your users.

I'm just pointing out that the feature you're wishing exists very likely
already exists in practice. Unless GitHub is stupid they aren't going to be
complaining about you pegging 5 CPU cores for $200/month.
