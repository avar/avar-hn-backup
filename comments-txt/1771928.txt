Yes it's great. The follow-up talk by Officer George Bruch of the Virginia
Beach Police Department is also very informative: http://video.google.com/

The gist of it is that he completely agrees with Professor James Duane that
talking to the police always goes against your best interests, and goes on to
discuss practical interview techniques that the police use to get suspects to
talk.
