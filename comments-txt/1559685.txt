> Bill and Melinda Gates have done tremendous good in the world, and anyone who
thinks otherwise is either crude or uninformed.

Their foundation has done a lot of good, but it doesn't exist in a vacuum. Why
does it have all that money in the first place?

Well, mostly because Microsoft managed to work itself into a monopoly position
with dirty tactics, and the proliferation of their own proprietary file
formats. This meant that millions of people and organizations had to pay the
Microsoft tax, which was later used to start the B&M Gates Foundation.

How many millions of US$ would those people have donated to charity if their
budgets hadn't been constrained by purchasing Microsoft software? Some of them
were probably African countries that could have used that money to buy vaccines
10 years ago.

Don't get me wrong, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is doing some good work
now, but to only look at their current donations is to only see the tip of the
iceberg.
