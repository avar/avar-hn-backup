This theory isn't citing the report itself, but independent analysis that's
been done on the same data. The Wikipedia article on the topic has a whole
section for these [1], and a section about this theory in particular [2].

Furthermore. The official accident report for crashes is not always considered
the authoritative source for what happened. One good example is EgyptAir Flight
990 which the official report claims is a mechanical failure [3], but which is
widely considered to have been pilot suicide. In that case the Egyptian
investigative body was thought to be politically motivated.

Similarly, it's not at all implausible that the French BEA would be reluctant
to make conclusions that could result in the grounding of the entire worldwide
Airbus fleet while they're retrofitted with Boeing-style controls while France
is the main Airbus manufacturing partner country.
