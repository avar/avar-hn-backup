Countering "there's no economic reason to put humans into orbit" with "but look
at these commercial programs 100% paid by the government" isn't really a
rebuke, you're just making the OPs point for them.

It's only commercial in the sense that say there's say commercial manufacturing
of ballistic missile submarines. It's just an implementation detail of how the
US (v.s. say China) does manufacturing for purely state-sponsored projects, not
something indicating that there's an economic incentive to put people into
orbit outside of government sponsored programs.
