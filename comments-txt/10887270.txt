    > no autoconf

Mentioning this in the same breath as "no segfaults" seems odd, does Rust use
some other build configuration tool, or does it just not have the need for
compile-time configuration detection? If it's the latter how does that even
work?

Are there no optional libraries? No outdated libraries whose version you have
to detect? No obscure platforms whose architecture you have to detect for
unsafe inline code etc.?

Because if you can have any of those or any number of other cases where you
need compile-time detection of configuration options you're going to need
something like autoconf.
