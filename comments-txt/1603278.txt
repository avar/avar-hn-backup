It doesn't just have it for backwards compatibility, it's still a very useful
feature in some cases:

    sub foo {
        local $ENV{HOME} = "/foo/bar";
        Code::I::Don't::Own();
    }
    foo();

Having dynamic scope here ensures that the foreign code will use the
environment I want without me having to alter it.
