If everyone was satisfied with keeping their computers for longer or buying
used then it stands to reason that the price of new computers would go down,
e.g. what are now $300-500 Chromebooks would be top of the line.

In any case, I think, with respect, that you're postulating an absurd
hypothetical scenario that's never going to happen. There's always going to be
some people who buy new and others who buy used, think used cars, clothes etc.

Phones & laptops are now a mature technology, the days when you need a new
computer to run spreadsheets or browse the Internet are over. Nowadays a 5 year
old computer is just as good for pretty much any application except AAA games.

The GP was mentioning students as needing phones & laptops. I'm pointing out
that students in particular think nothing of buying say used clothes because
they don't have a lot of money, but for some reason a lot more people have
expensive new gadgets they don't need.
