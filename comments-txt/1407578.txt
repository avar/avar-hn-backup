That's interesting. Are there any recent benchmarks of Lua on Parrot v.s.
LuaJIT? The only thing I could find was this from 2007 where it was ~2 orders
of magnitude slower: http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.internals/2007/
09/...

The URL to the benchmark script was broken so I couldn't run it.

Don't get me wrong, I think Parrot's very neat. But I could see why compiler
implementors would be sceptical of it since it's not feature complete, and
seemingly not very optimized. So there's a lot of unknowns.
