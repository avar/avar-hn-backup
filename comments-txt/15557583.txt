This is a bit like saying "I don't get why web development is overworking
people, just look at all this cool stuff Google is doing with the Go runtime!".

Most people who work in the game industry are not doing deep game engine
hacking, but doing grunt work like scripting/designing some scene in a giant
adventure game who's going to have thousands of those, and all of those need to
be finished before the release date.
