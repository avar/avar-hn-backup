Because if the fuel tank breaks you can just weld pretty much any replacement
on and it'll work, you could even use a bucket on the back of your pick-up
trunk & a hose as a temporary replacement.

That's not the case with electric cars and their batteries. They're deeply
integrated with the rest of the powertrain.
