I think calling it a 50% success rate is disingenuous. The "failure" they had
was because the satellite wasn't the primary mission, it was piggy-backing on
the primary mission. It didn't make its orbit because after a recoverable
mishap NASA didn't want to take any chances with the orbit of the ISS.

That's not a failure of the rocket. It's just the operator of the primary
mission calling the shots, and the secondary mission suffering as a result of
that. That's the sort of risk you assume when you piggy-back on the primary
payload when launching on any rocket.
