Yes, but generally those will average out, and other than carbon emissions the
environmental impact tends to get pretty well priced into the end product
because it tends to be more land or resources that are required.

I put "carbon emissions" in parentheses there because the reason for this "buy
local" fallacy to begin with is because people intuitively assume that it's the
transportation of the good that makes all the difference, when the reality is
that that's just 1/10 of the cost.

The environmental impact of the transportation is almost exclusively carbon
emissions.
