The eruption is small now but that this could become serious isn't an
overstatement.

I can't recall the details now but I've reviewed the evacuation plan (but can't
find it now) used for the area.

Once Mýrdalsjökull starts erupting it's only a matter of hours before the
meltwater starts flooding across the lowlands. It'll be a glacial mudflow many
meters high initially and the water/mud should be at around 1 meter at
Hvolsvöllur ~40 kilometers away.

Earlier Hekla eruptions have caused global cooling for a few years. Wikipedia
has more information on it.
