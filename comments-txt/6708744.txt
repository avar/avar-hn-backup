I see this person didn't use Wikpedia before 2007, it used to have exactly what
he's suggesting: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Spoiler#
Why_spoiler_...

In addition to the arguments listed there the thing that bothered me most about
it was that it imposed a straitjacket on the editorializing of any article that
contained spoilers, you now had to bend over backwards to partition it into
spoiler and non-spoiler sections.
