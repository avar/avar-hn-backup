In reply to that:

1) I find that for the large repos I work on the difference goes from
"noticeably slow" to "I don't notice it" which is somewhere on the magical
~200ms boundary.

2) This really doesn't help, the Git repo is likely in the FS cache anyway,
you'll get exactly the same results / speedup if you do this in /dev/shm i.e.
the in-memory filesystem.

This has nothing to do with fast drives, it has to do with syscall overhead.
Recursively stat-ing a huge directory is simply never going to be all that
fast.

3) Irrelevant for the reasons noted above.
