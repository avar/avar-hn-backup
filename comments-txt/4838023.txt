Say I'm looking for a mapping application and one doesn't even have data for
where I live, or some other attribute that would cause me not to consider it in
6 months when I look for mapping apps again.

I do the same for restaurant reviews, I might give one 1 star even though it
serves palatable food, just not the kind I like.

By doing so the recommendation algorithms that harvest my feedback have access
to both positive and negative feedback pertinent to me to give me better future
results.

That's how those kinds of scoring systems work best, not by averaging
everyone's scores and pretending we're all robots that (dis)like the same
things.
