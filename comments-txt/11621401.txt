You wouldn't need to abolish property rights. Another way to look at it is that
you'd essentially transfer the cost of social programs to people through
insurance instead of through taxation.

Additionally you'd create a pressure in society to increase wealth equality /
charity and opportunities for the needy / poor, since nobody likes to be stolen
from all the time.

Right now the poor are an abstract problem for many, especially the rich, if
you ran the risk of being stolen from directly maybe you'd have a stake in
increasing wealth equality. Or maybe you'd just hire private security.

It might actually be a better system, or it might not, who knows?
