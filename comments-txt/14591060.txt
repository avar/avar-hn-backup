Do you have a source for that? According to this article[1] which is
summarizing an official Japanese zoning document [2] they have 12 well-defined

They're overall more relaxed about mixed-use zoning, but they do have
exclusively industrial zones, and exclusively residential (with small shops &
schools) zones.
