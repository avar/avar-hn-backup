Grafts allow you to do a bunch of other neat stuff. I use Git as a backup
system for SQL dumps, but since the repository will grow a lot I want to throw
old dumps away.

So I just create a graft and rewrite my history so that it only contains 7
commits (7 days):

    git rev-list HEAD | sed '7q;d' > .git/info/grafts &&
    git filter-branch -f HEAD
