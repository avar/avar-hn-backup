It's not "fully subjective" by any sensible definition. Yes humans are the
measurement device, and humans differ and are unreliable, but given a
sufficient number of samples you arrive at more accurate numbers.

Nobody's going to give a paprika the same rating as a Carolina Reaper. You
might have some give two very strong peppers the same rating, but then you
might just need more people to test it.

In any case, the practical utility of the scale is mostly to get an idea of how
spicy something is, it doesn't really matter much if something is 700K or 600K,
it's enough to know that it's around 2x as strong as a Habanero.
