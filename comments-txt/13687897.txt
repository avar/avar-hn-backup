I live in Amsterdam and mostly bike around, but sometimes you need to get a car
for whatever reason.

Uber's much cheaper. I've had a car from the airport into the city go as low as
17 EUR, usually around 25. Hailing a taxi costs at least 40 EUR.

It's also very convenient to know the location of your arriving taxi for
knowing when to leave a party and leaving out several minutes of explaining the
route to the driver.

It's also not uncommon for taxi drivers here to drive you a much longer route
if they think you're not a local and don't know where they're going. It's
happened to me, and several of my friends. Never happened with Uber.

I've also found service with Uber to be much better. The first time I tried it
here in Amsterdam the driver offered me a bottle of water and asked how I was
doing. That had never happened to me once here in Amsterdam. The customer
ability to rate drivers does wonders for service over traditional taxi
companies.
