Even if I give you that a network connected phone is something a teenager
absolutely must have, that still leaves the fact that most people vastly
overspend on these items.

Yes you might need a smartphone and a laptop for school, but those are going to
cost at most $200 used, but people conflate the need for these devices with the
fashion statement of owning the latest iPhone or MacBook.
