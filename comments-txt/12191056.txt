The context to my comment is AnimalMuppet's hyperbolic reply that pacifism in
the face of the enemy would somehow result in the destruction or enslavement of
your whole society.

I'm pointing out that if say the French had surrendered to the Germans early in
WWI there's no historical evidence that that would have been the case, and
likely countless lives would have been saved.

The destruction of the state is not synonymous with the destruction of the
people in it. Most wars only seek to abolish state power, not the people that
make up those states.
