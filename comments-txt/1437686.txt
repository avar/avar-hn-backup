First of all, under normal circumstances she never would have been anywhere
close to being prime minister. The only reason (seemingly) that she got the job
was that after the collapse of the previous government the new leftist
coalition needed someone to pass the buck to, and she was pretty much the only
uncontroversial figure they had.

Her coalition government's only redeeming quality has been to suck less than
their predecessors which facilitated the giant ponzi scheme which took down the
economy. They're wasting a lot of effort on the equivalent of rearranging the
deck chairs on the Titanic.

One shining moment of incompetence was the press conference right after the
president announced that the Icesave debt repayment bill would go to a public
referendum.

She announced (well, mumbled actually) that the government was "disappointed"
in the President's decision to bring the matter to a vote in a rushed
international press conference hours after the announcement.

What they should have done is explain calmly that this was part of the
democratic process in Iceland, and how the result might affect any future debt
repayment.

Examples like these and countless others have shown that her and her government
can't think two steps ahead, manage PR and foreign diplomacy horribly, and
generally seem more interested in their pet leftist issues (which they can
finally shove through, now that they're in power) rather than solving the
problems facing the nation.

But what do I care, I moved abroad shortly after this all went down.
