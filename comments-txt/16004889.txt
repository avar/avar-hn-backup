I'm referring to the policy of still maintaining the systems necessary to
launch on warning, past promises about how the systems will be used are just
PR.

It's not like in a hypothetical scenario where Russia has launched hundreds of
ICBMs at the US in a first strike scenario Trump (or any other president) is
going to feel beholden to some promise Clinton made in the 90s.

The president has absolute power over when and how to launch nuclear weapons,
and can do so at a moment's notice, as has been covered extensively in the
media in the last year where people seemed shocked that the president had this
power since they didn't like the new person in office, even though the power
itself hasn't changed in more than half a century.
