Astronomy Cast: A hard science (almost exclusively discusses accepted peer
reviewed theories) podcast about cosmology. Everything from the Big Bang to
Missions to Mars: http://www.astronomycast.com/

The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe: A skeptical podcast by Steven Novella &
co. They cover a lot of interesting topics, and some other ones that I'm not a
big fan of. But overall pretty good: http://www.theskepticsguide.org/
