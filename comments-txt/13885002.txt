For those excited about the "Guile's Elisp implementation" in this release. The
last major Guile release was 6 years ago, and much of this GuileEmacs work is
still highly WIP and from my searching on emacs-devel seems to have stalled in
2015 for lack of volunteers.

Just because Guile implements Elisp the language doesn't mean there isn't a ton
of work to be done on Emacs itself to swap out its native VM for Guile, and it
seems nobody's keen on finishing up that work.
