Agreed, overall they're safe. I'm just pointing out that the time of the
phase-out in the US is effectively FAA-mandated due to the airlines not wanting
to retrofit the fleet, as e.g. BA has apparently done.

This is an interesting bit of trivia, and not something you'll find in airline
press releases since for better or worse it's going to make them look worse in
the eyes of their customers.

There's ~500 747s[1] in service. So 30k/500 =~ 60yrs, or a 25% chance that one
will blow up in the next 15 years. So this seems like a reasonable retrofit
given the cost.

I assume that the FAA knows what it's doing and 12% oxygen helps, even if it's
not 9%, similarly I assume they've taken into account the risk of retrofitting
existing planes, since they started explicitly mandating that in 2008.
