The two aren't really comparable. With Newtonian physics there were clear signs
decades before Einstein that something wasn't right, the clearest example being
the perihelion precession of Mercury: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/

In modern particle physics the main limitation is lack of experimental data. To
get that data we have to build giant and expensive experiments like the LHC.
Even if the LHC is completely successful we're still going to need bigger
colliders to test other things at even higher energies.

Another problem is that the current theories make predictions about things that
we probably won't ever be able to measure directly due to the microscopic
scales involved.

To name an example. We think that gluons exist inside atomic nuclei, but we
can't observe them unless we break the nuclei apart, thus destroying the
gluon's habitat. We think it's there because we see what looks like the energy
of a gluon falling apart, and because mathematical models back it up.
