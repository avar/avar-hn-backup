One thing to keep in mind when looking at GNU programs is that they're often
intentionally written in an odd style to remove all questions of Unix copyright
infringement at the time that they were written.

The long-standing advice when writing GNU utilities used to be that if the
program you were replacing was optimized for minimizing CPU use, write yours to
minimize memory use, or vice-versa. Or in this case, if the program was
optimized for simplicity, optimize for throughput.

It would have been very easy for the nascent GNU project to unintentionally
produce a line-by-line equivalent of BSD yes.c, which would have potentially
landed them in the 80/90s equivalent of the Google v.s. Oracle case.
