For reasons I won't go into the farming lobby is really strong in Iceland.

Sheep run free-range around the entire island, if you'd like to grow something
that sheep like to eat you need to fence it in. It's not like pretty much
anywhere else in the western world where people who own grazing animals need to
fence them in.

Thus the sheep range far and wide and destroy Iceland's native low-lying
forests. Iceland's native crooked birch hasn't developed resistance to grazing
animals as mainland trees had to do, the sheep love to nibble at them and eat
the seedlings.

The native trees and other native vegetation are generally much hardier than
the foreign plants. But since the forestry service has lost the battle with the
farming lobby they're desperately trying to introduce some trees that the sheep
won't eat.

Reforesting the country is largely being done through subsidies to farmers, who
aren't concerned with topsoil preservation beyond maintaining the desolate
landscape they inherited, but they are interested in the eventual promise of a
commercial forest on their land.

Which is something to keep in mind when reading articles like these and
wondering "why don't they...", usually the answer is that they're planting in a
field that's going to be full of grazing animals, and there's no way the
forestry service is going to win that battle anytime soon, or that they're not
really aiming to restore the topsoil per-se, but to do that as a side-effect of
commercial logging.
