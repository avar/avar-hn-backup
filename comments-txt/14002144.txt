They're not the final arbiter, if the SCOTUS does something wrong the
constitution can be amended to clarify or change the intent of the law. Then
the SCOTUS will be beholden to that constitutional amendment.

That there isn't political will to routinely do this in response to bad SCOTUS
rulings is not an inherent problem with the system itself.
