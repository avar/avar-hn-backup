As Buzz points out, one of the biggest problem with the current space plans is
the "we'll go there, and be back in time for tea" attitude. I.e. the
requirement that anyone going to the Moon, Mars etc. be able to return.

We should be aiming for colonizing space with one-way trips and subsequent
supply drops. The colonies should aim to become as self-sustainable as possible
using robotic factories to mine and produce what they need on-location.
