Is there any information on whether the drivers on the phone will be open
source as well? I'm on the fence, but the main thing stopping me is that I'm
not very keen on buying yet another phone powered by a bunch of proprietary
binary blobs.

I'd like to hack on the software, build my own, try to install Debian on it
instead etc. All that is going to be much harder if I have to use whatever
kernel version their binary blobs target.
