Maybe some companies don't view their employees as their exclusive property
that they have to be kept under wraps. If you take this idea to its logical
conclusion you'd have to ban your employees from using sites like LinkedIn,
which make it really easy to find out who works where.

Much better to show your employees that they're appreciated at your company,
then maybe they'll continue staying because they really like their job, not
because you've set up some policy where other companies who might want to hire
them can't find out who they are.
