Maybe you're looking for something more than a gift, but are you actually
entitled to more than that? Are you a shareholder in these companies than you
fund through Kickstarter? I think not.

So why do you think you have any rights beyond someone who's donating money to
a cause that may never pan out?

It's perfectly fine to fund something through Kickstarter, but for some reason
it seems that some people doing it think they're entering into a deal that
isn't really there.

Generally when you give money through Kickstarter you're giving it away without
any string attached, only if the company pans out might you actually get some
small gift, not a share of the profit.

What's so hard to understand about that? The model's fine. The problem is that
for some reason people donating to it think of themselves as shareholders, not
donors.
