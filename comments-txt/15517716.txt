What I meant was that at the time the Norse disappeared there were other people
in Greenland living in far harsher conditions, as the map accompanying this
article shows: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorset_culture#Historical_and_...

I think you're thinking about Dorset culture which arrived in the south of
Greenland after the Norse disappeared, but as the map shows when the Norse
disappeared the Thule culture coexisted with them in Greenland far in the north
where conditions were worse.

Which shows you that the problem was not that the area was uninhabitable, but
that the Norse didn't have the knowledge or desire to survive there.
