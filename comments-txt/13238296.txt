Even when you contact their customer support about it they just shrug it off
and do nothing.

I ordered a weightlifting belt from them earlier this year, an "Inzer" which is
an expensive brand, like advertising a laptop as "Apple".

Turns out it wasn't an Inzer, but I was actually overall happy with it for the
price. Contacted the seller, they gave me BS about "Inzer is just what this
type of belt is called", which is 100% untrue. It's like saying thin grey
laptops are called "Apple".

So I contacted Amazon customer support about it. The guy kept trying to send me
a return receipt, I said I didn't want to return it, the product was fine for
my use for the price, but they should fix the listing.

It's still up in unchanged form today, although they're currently out of stock:
