That's completely wrong. You're fundamentally misunderstanding what the free
software movement is about. Ultimately it's a sort of grassroots consumer
protection movement, not a bunch of hippies trying to abolish money.

Stallman believes that you should vote with your feet and avoid using non-free
software, and that if we all did this for everything there would be no space
for non-free software in the market.

That doesn't mean that you can't sell software. The FSF has always sold copies
of their software (I know because I've bought some). All of their licenses
allow you to sell software, they consider any license that doesn't allow this
to be non-free.
