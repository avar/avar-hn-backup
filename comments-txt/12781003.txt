For plenty of people something like the weather or the government really is the
reason they moved.

The government was a major reason for my move. I moved after the collapse,
which was entirely caused by Iceland's dysfunctional government policies (none
of which have really changed), and the measures put into place post-collapse
largely benefited homeowners at the expense of the rest of us.

I didn't want to spend the next decade paying for other people's bad financial
decisions at the cost of the currency & my purchasing power having fallen
around 1/2.

Similarly people move from say the UK to Spain for the weather. As I'm sure you
know Iceland doesn't just have "bad" weather, it's on a whole different level
where working around the weather often becomes a major logistical difficulty.
Whole towns often become snowed in during the winter.

So it's hardly a surprise that someone would move just to be rid of that.
