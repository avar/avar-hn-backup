There's no need for a trusted singular provider. You can just implement this
sort of thing as a circle of trust.

A leak could be made by anyone. But content would only be published on
somerandomsite.com if it has been digitally signed by someone.

Who that someone is could be configurable. wikileaks.com would be things that
are only signed by Assange, but you could spin up your own site with your own
signing policies.
