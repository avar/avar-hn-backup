There have been totally unproved speculations that they've been doing that. But
if they did it on a scale like that their CA would be revoked from all default
browser installations.

They could still force the issue and mandate that their CA be patched back in
on all computers sold in mainland China.

Either case seems very unlikely, just outright blocking things they don't like
seems to be their current approach. I don't see why they'd change that for
Google.
