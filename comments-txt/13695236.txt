The money quote from the book is:

    > [...] What made it possible for me to exercise

    > to know the future. Conversely, now that I know
    > the future, I would never act contrary to that
    > future, including telling others what I know.

I.e. her situation is completely analogous to Paul Atreides in Dune. She can
see the future, she can change events, but if she ever did she couldn't see the
future anymore. So she throws her daughter under the metaphorical bus to retain
her powers.

I think it's a rather bleak story, "woman can see future events, prefers to
live out the spoiler version of her life rather than changing anything and
being surprised", but whatever, at least it's internally consistent.

What I'm pointing out is that the storyline of the movie makes absolutely no
sense, because there she can see the future and is able to change events based
on that information, not lose her seeing powers, and seemingly create time
loops where people in the future only did certain things because she did them
in the present, based on information they gave her in the future because she
did that!

The movie tries to evade this problem with a slight of hand. They change the
circumstances of her daughter's death to be inevetable, otherwise the audience
would be up in arms at the obvious contradiction that she can change the future
based on seeing what General Shang is going to do, but somehow can't tell her
daughter not to take up climbing as a hobby.
