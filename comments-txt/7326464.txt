I've seen nasty bugs in Python code having to do with the end of blocks losing
their indentation due to someone's merge/editor mistake.

Having braces or other explicit start/end markers for blocks would have
prevented those issues. So Python's syntax can in some cases encourage these
sorts of mistakes.
