RAM is cheap.

What's not cheap is requesting RAM from the OS piecemeal.

In this particular case the curl maintainer ended up saving a bit of RAM as a
side-effect, but it's actually much more common for programs that benefit from
this class of optimization to waste RAM as a side-effect, and yet be much
faster.

For example a common optimization in high-level programming languages is to
overallocate memory for strings. E.g. if the user requests "x" you allocate 16
bytes, if you need 17 bytes you allocate 32 etc.

This wastes RAM, a 513 byte string will malloc 1024 bytes, but ends up being
much faster on overage exactly because RAM is cheap, but allocations are
expensive.
