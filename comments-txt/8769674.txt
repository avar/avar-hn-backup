Nobody's disputing that, but the Japanese custom for adult adoption is
something else entirely: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_adult_adoption

So if you adopt a child and raise it as your own and that child takes over your
business, is it still a "family business? Yes.

But can you say it's still a "family" business if it's gone through the
Japanese custom of adult adoption? Arguably yes, because that person was
brought into their family as a legitimate heir.

On the other hand you could argue that it's no different than a family business
being sold in the western sense, it's just that in ancient Japan you couldn't
really buy and sell businesses, they were owned by clans, so this was their
mechanism for ensuring business continuity when there was no suitable male
heir.

I'm not taking a stance on whether it's still a "real" family business, but
it's important to understand that what the Japanese mean by "adoption" in this
sense is not at all what westerners mean when they use that word.
