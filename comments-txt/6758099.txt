Partly yes, but being able to control the macro economy is arguably a much
greater power in a western state than the monopoly on coercive force.

Force mostly has to be individually applied, and you can only take it so far
before you have massive pushback in the form of civil unrest.

Printing money, to pick a simple example, is much more effective and can be
done across the economy as a whole.

Could you imagine police forces breaking into everyone's home and taking half
their cash in a matter of days? It's unthinkable that that would happen for
logistical reasons alone.

But that's what we've effectively seen some modern western governments do just
recently by rapidly deflating their currencies.

Abolishing fiat currency would take away that power, and make no mistake it is
an immense power. It's the power to shape entire economies at the stroke of a
pen.
