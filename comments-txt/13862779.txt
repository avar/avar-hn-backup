No, it really couldn't. I'm replying to your economic fallacy of asserting that
"[a] program for a million people will cost more [than a program for one
person]". Of course that's literally true in terms of absolute dollar amounts,
but it's not true in the sense that actually matters. I.e. if you had a million
extra people in your country would they be a net drain on your economy, or net
contributors?

To answer that question it doesn't matter that they're illegal immigrants or
legal immigrants. You can't assume that just because someone's illegal they're
more likely to be a net drain on the economy, actually the reverse is probably
likelier to be true, since an illegal immigrant will seek work but can't make
use of social services provided to people legally in the country.

    > I'm not assuming that [illegal immigrants are a

I really hate to put words into someone's mouth, but the most generous reading
of what you're saying really does sound like that's what you're actually
saying.

You're asserting that having X number of "illegal" immigrants is going to have
some linear drain on the economy as a function of X, it's not at all clear that
that relationship exists in any sense, i.e. it could be a gain not a drain, and
it could be non-linear.
