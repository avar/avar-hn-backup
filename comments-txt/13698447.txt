:<whatever> means "read it from the <whatever>" file. See the last part of the
relevant glibc documentation: https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/libc/
manual/html_...

However the reason it works without : is that the implementation is being lazy
and just ignores the : delimiter and falls back to parsing out a filename
either way:
