Once you change the constitution it can't be thrown out be the SCOTUS by
definition. They can interpret constitutional law or declare law
unconstitutional, they can't blatantly ignore the constitution (well, in
theory...).

In short, the facility to reverse supreme court decisions is a constitutional
amendment.
