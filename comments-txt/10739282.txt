What if they had won? What bearing does suing the Wikimedia Foundation, a US
entity, for material published in the US under US publishing laws?

The German Wikipedia is published and maintained by a US entity, there's a
local German Wikimedia chapter but it's not the publisher of the German
Wikipedia. The article says that they sued the US entity (the Wikimedia
Foundation Inc., not Wikimedia Deutschland), but doesn't explain this issue.
