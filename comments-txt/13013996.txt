Who: Aside from Yosemite, the answer is "it depends", a lot of these are just
set up by enterprising enthusiasts, often technically illegally, but few care
enough to bother them.

In some parks & locations they're set up by whoever manages the park / owns the
area to attract climbers & the business that comes with it.

Some people in the mountaineering / climbing community don't like them since
they leave a permanent trace ("take only photos, leave only footprints"), and
prefer to use removable versions of these for just the duration of the climb.
