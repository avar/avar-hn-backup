Both this submarine and the semi-submersibles they had earlier have crews. It'd
be very interesting if they can develop something completely autonomous. E.g. a
10 meter tube that navigates by GPS, occasionally surfaces to get its bearings,
and has enough diesel for a ~5000km ocean voyage.

You could program that to zig-zag across the ocean and land on a beach
somewhere, where you could extract the cargo, refuel it, and send it back.
