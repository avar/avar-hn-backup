Maybe someone else's servers wouldn't be down when you post a link to your blog
on HN.

As someone who hosts a lot of his own stuff, that's the real selling point of
cloud hosting. Not having to care about things like spam filtering, or how some
blog you want to publish is going to scale in the face of unexpected traffic.
