That guy is going to be interviewing at some company with someone who's
obsessive enough about outage reports to remember a then-obscure one years
later, but enough of an idiot to not understand that people aren't personally
to blame for this sort of stuff?

Sounds like even in that very contrived scenario the guy involved would dodge a
bullet in not being hired by a bunch of idiots.
