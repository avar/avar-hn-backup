The way you generally deal with the second problem is to have a profiler that
can give you the inclusive time spent in a subroutine, not just the exclusive
time. The inclusive time is the time spent in that sub and in subs it calls,
the exclusive time is time spent only in that sub.

When you have inclusive time it usually becomes easy to find that function
that's spending 80% of the time in either itself or in the things it calls.
