What does the heterogeneous populations of the US have to do with it? Maybe
when it comes to life expectancy you're right, because genetics is a large
factor in that. But when it comes to literacy rate and the proportion of
physicians that's entirely down to government policy.

Do you really think the US couldn't beat Cuba on those metrics if they decided
spending money on those topics was more important than spending money on the
military?
