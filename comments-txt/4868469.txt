It's not just budget ,the Voyager program took advantage of a favorable
planetary alignment that wouldn't recur for 175 years: http://en.wikipedia.org/

I have no idea how favorable this was, i.e. whether you could get the same
effect today with more propulsion, but it's quite possible that we don't have
the technology to do this in any reasonable timeframe today.
