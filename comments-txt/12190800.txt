I don't think it's fair to list the US on that list in the same sense as China
and Russia.

The US has declared that it's going to abide by the treaty except on the Korean
peninsula, which is entirely about the mines in the Korean DMZ meant to stop
North Korean tanks from rolling in.

That's not comparable to the general use of anti-personnel landmines in
warfare. It's a specific cordoned off area with big signs surrounding it saying
"enter here and die".
