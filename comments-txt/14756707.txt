For the user. What you're describing is still going to cause complex UX.

So let's say I'm interested in exactly two things. Russian dash cam videos and
videos of trains without narration.

I go to the homepage and click on one type of video, what should the next video
be? A random video from the two categories? One or the other? Should it show me
a banner at the top indicating what recommendation mode I'm in (historical
preference or "similar to current video").

Now I go and do the same on my Android YouTube app which has no real UI
equivalent of a homepage, what happens then?

This is a lot of UX complexity for a feature few probably care about.
