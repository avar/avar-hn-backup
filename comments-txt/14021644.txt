I think your inability to have a civil discussion without needlessly throwing
insults around speaks for itself.

There are trivial no-brainer cases where the potential for free cancellations
allows you to offload costs on someone else.

E.g. you and your 4 friends need to get from A->B together, you each order an
Uber for the ride, but you only intend to use one car. The ETAs are in the
range of 15-25 minutes, you all have the "Fake Battery Status" app installed &
cancel 3 of the cars when the first one has an ETA of < 2 minutes.

Now you're able to get where you need to go 5-10 minutes earlier than you
otherwise would have, at no extra cost, but you've incurred a cost on Uber &
lost opportunity (& real fuel costs) on the driver.
