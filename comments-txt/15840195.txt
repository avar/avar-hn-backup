I have not assumed that, we're commenting on a specific sub-problem they
mentioned in their post in this thread, yes they made it abundantly clear that
it wasn't the only reason.

Between copyright issues on YouTube, getting around that by working with a big
partner that would sell their content, and getting donations on Patreon, they
never seemed to have considered selling access to high-quality content for a
fee without partnering with someone.

I listen to several Podcasts that have something like this as a monetization
model, i.e. some sort of paid-for premium content or content exclusively for
subscribers.
