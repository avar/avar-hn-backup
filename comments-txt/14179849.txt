You seem insistent on having some side-thread argument with me for some reason.

The article we're both commenting on goes to great length to point this out. I
don't know why you're trying to convince me or anyone else of this.

Yes, in a network library malloc overhead isn't usually a worthwhile thing to
worry about, but libcurl is hardly just any random library.

I'm not trying to convince you that you should consider libc part of the OS.

I was merely clarifying that in the context of my comment, which you replied to
assuming I just meant the kernel, that I was talking about the C library as
well.

FWIW lots of people use "Operating System" to mean the set of software you get
by default. OpenBSD, GNU, OSX, Android etc. definitely consider libc to be part
of the OS, and Android probably considers its java class library part of the
base OS. If everyone meant "the kernel" by "the OS" we'd just say "the kernel".

You don't have to agree with that, but correcting people on that point is about
as futile as trying to convince people that your use of "hacker" is correct.
