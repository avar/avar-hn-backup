Isn't this exactly the same as the often repeated argument (in various forms)
of "why are we spending money on space when we have cancer/poverty/other social
issues/etc.".

I don't have the intimate knowledge on China that you do, nor do I agree with
its government, but it's a country that's moving so fast to being
industrialized that it has some parts that are effectively in the early 20th
century, and some that are as high-tech as you can get.

Don't you think China spending a relatively minuscule part of its resources on
developing high-tech industries is likely to do its part in developing these
rural areas that you're concerned about in the long term? As for the short term
surely China is also working on those issues.
