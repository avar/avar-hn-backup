It's been some time but I've read the entire report cover-to-cover. While yes,
the general conclusion is that NASA's dysfunctional management structure and
institutional optimism driven by moneyed interests is the primary culprit. The
report never really tries to perform a root cause analysis on how something
like the O-ring "safety factor" problem arose.

Something which, as summarized by Feynman's quote above, should be patently
obvious to any engineer as bullshit.

Feynman's appendix is the only part that even tries, but it doesn't go far
enough through no fault of Feynman's, he had no resources to pursue this line
of inquiry. It was a struggle just to get that appendix into the report.

They should have interviewed every single person in any way remotely involved
in that O-ring decision, find out if they objected to it, and if they didn't
what money/institutional/social obstacles there were to prevent that.

Did some engineer actually sign off on the aforementioned "safety factor"? We
don't know, but somehow I doubt that's language management came up with on
their own, and if they did that there was no way for an engineer to spot that
and report "wtf? The system doesn't work like that!".

Reading between the lines some engineer actually did come up with that
estimate, but likely that engineer was where he was because NASA had a culture
of promoting mindless yes-men.
