As another resident of Amsterdam. I don't think your impression of the
situation really matches up with statistics. Look at these two articles:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-r... http://
projects.oregonlive.com/ucc-shooting/gun-deaths

Here you can see the gun death rate in The Netherlands per 100k inhabitants is
0.58, but there's some areas in the US where the rate is quite comparable.

What really sets things apart is the suicide rate, most deaths by guns in the
US are by suicide, but there's counties in the US where there's easy access to
guns and the overall death rate is lower than the Dutch gun violence + non-gun
suicides.

So in a lot of cases it's not that just having guns makes everything
hyper-violent. It's just that if people feel like killing themselves they'll
use the best available instrument available to them.

Conflating that with general gun safety as it pertains to you feeling safe
walking around Amsterdam, but not in a comparable town in the US, is silly.
