I do pretty much this but I have public dotfiles (on github), then an overlay
for work files so I need a script to maintain those symlinks, and then work
ones that I don't share with coworkers (contain private passwords).

So I have a script that manages the symlinks for multiple such repos, knows to
remove the broken links as needed, and I have something I can just paste into
the terminal of any machine and it'll set that box up with my public/work/
private dotfiles as appropriate.

It's not perfect, but it works, just pointing out that even for relatively
simple cases having a dotfile manager (or writing your own) can make sense.
