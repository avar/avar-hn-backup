   > it can all be accomplished with other tools

Sure it can be accomplished with other tools, but if Git is sufficient
introducing other tools just increases the complexity of your stack, and the
complexity of e.g. validating that a Git tag corresponds to what claims to be
rolled out as that tag.

This is a constraint a lot of people seem to think they need but they don't
actually need. If someone gets your current checkout they'll have current code
/ passwords (if you accidentally checked in a password but removed it you
should change that password). Getting the code history will just satisfy
historical curiosity. Hardly a pressing concern for an attacker.

Yes, but the point is that it just gives you that for free without you having
to hack anything extra on top of your syncing mechanism.

You'd be pleasantly surprised how much checking/validation/syncing logic that
you have to write around e.g. rsync when syncing a Git repo just disappears
entirely if you just use Git to sync the files.
