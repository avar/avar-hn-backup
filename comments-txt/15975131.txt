    > Downvoted and rightly so.

I don't care about the internet points, but I'd like to point out, account
created ~30m ago, that you're using HN the wrong way. Downvoting is not a "I
disagree" button like on Reddit, it's a "this is not interesting to discuss"
button, the fact that you're replying at all shows that it's not the latter.

No it's certainly not the same, but it is interesting to think about how
established precedence for the discretion of advertisers, given their limited
money resources and the fact that they have to pick some audience will be
applied to social media.

How many newspaper subscriptions do you need? What do those cost? I'm just
pointing out that there's always been a pay-to-play element to job seeking. In
some sense what FB is enabling is shitty, but on the other hand the fee to play
has never been lower.

I have zero relation to Facebook, and for what it's worth I wish it didn't
exist, but if it didn't the next FB clone would just replace it.
