I know this isn't the right place for a Yahoo! bug report, but they don't reply
to me elsewhere.

I keep getting spam from Yahoo! in the form of people signing me up for some
group, just today someone signed me up for the "vjth group" with the group
description "iqdjgpwo62r683fs".

There's a link in the E-Mail saying "You may also change your email preferences
to prevent group owners from adding you to their groups.". But when I follow it
and change my E-Mail preferences I get:

    Groups error

    We're Sorry...
    There was a problem with your request.
    The page you've requested returned this error:

I've been getting this error for the last 6 months or so. Stop spamming me
Yahoo!.
