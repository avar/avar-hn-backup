If the market changed overnight so that nobody wanted to buy non-free cars,
which for the sake of argument we'll define here as cars where the full
schematics are under a free license like the GPL. Nothing would really change.

The main effort of making a car is still making the car. Just because you can
download recipes or a CAD drawing of a car chefs or car makers aren't going to
go out of business. They provide a valuable service that people want to buy.

Similarly, programs aren't going to write themselves. There's always going to
be demand for skilled programmers, just like there's demand for skilled
carpenters.
