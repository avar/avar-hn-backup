'The standard pluralized form of "octopus" in the English language is
"octopuses" although the Ancient Greek plural "octopodes", has also been used
historically.'[1].

The book "Octopus: The Ocean's Intelligent Invertebrate"[2] which I have here
says this on the matter: "By the way, the plural of octopus isn't octopi,
because the word is Greek -- octopus to be exact -- not Latin. The Greek plural
would be octopodes, but we call them octopuses."

You're not being pedantic as it pertains to this word in the English language,
you're just wrong.
