You can't run faster than the speed of light, i.e. it isn't just for lack of
trying. Explaining things in those terms to the layman helps them to understand
the issues. There's a large chasm between things that might potentially work,
and things that couldn't even work in theory.

Homeopathy is squarely in the latter category. The whole concept of water
memory is pseudoscientific nonesense.

Note that they're not just claiming that water has some special effect on the
human immune system. They're claiming that molecules are capable of
transmitting and retaining information in a manner that violates our
understanding of chemistry and physics.
