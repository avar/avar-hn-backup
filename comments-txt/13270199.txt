Does anyone know of interesting tours you can take of electricity production in
Europe or energy infrastructure in general? I'm in The Netherlands, but would
be willing to travel for it.

A real tour of a nuclear plant would be awesome (i.e. getting to hear / see the
reactor), but tours of wind farms / turbines / dams etc. would also be great.
Preferably in English.
