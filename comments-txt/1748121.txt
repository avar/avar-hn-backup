We've been referring to different things. Since you referred to "indefinite
space travel" I thought you were talking about not going to another solar
system at all, i.e. that "land" meant orbiting another sun.

But that was obviously a misreading on my part. Anyway, I completely agree with
you that once your ark ship arrives in a new solar system landing on a planet
like Gliese 581g would be counterproductive.

Instead of having to deal with a gravity well it would be better to make a home
in something like the asteroid belt. You only need energy & resources for
manufacturing capacity, a gravity well can only complicate that process.

People might still want to live on planets as a novelty, or for their
resources. But I think any society sufficiently advanced to develop a
generational ship that can traverse interstellar space would resemble The
Culture (i.e. a swarm of migrating ships & habitats) more than they would
resemble The Federation (i.e. people mostly living on planets with ships mainly
for transport).
