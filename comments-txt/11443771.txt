I understand "activist" in this context to be something closer to "interpreting
the law in some unusual way nobody could have thought of when they wrote it",
as opposed to "using a clause to the letter of the law in an unambiguous way
and any reasonable person would agree that that was the intent of the law to
begin with" which is the case with Ã“LG.

I think his detractors just don't like that he shit on their parade, so instead
of addressing that issue they're making this absurd argument that he used a
clause of law that had never been used before and ubsetting that status quo is
somehow bad, while conveniently forgetting that that unprecedented clause was
invoked in the midddle of an unprecedented financial crisis.
