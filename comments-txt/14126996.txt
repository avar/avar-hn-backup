    > 1) both of our MTAs do STARTTLS. And gmail is only TLS.

What you're implying here, i.e. that the communication is encrypted anyway,
isn't how E-Mail works at all.

Even if the GMail MXs are configured to only accept E-Mails over TLS, the
user's sensitive E-Mail may, depending on his settings, traverse multiple
servers with less secure settings before a connection is ever initiated with
the GMail MXs.

If someone's E-Mail is going to be MITM'd it's far more likely to happen
between the Internet caf√© he's sitting in and his ISP's badly configured SMTP
server than between his ISP's SMTP server and GMail's TLS-using MTA.

GMail using TLS will do nothing to protect against the message being MITM'd,
whereas GPG would, because it's end-to-end encryption, unlike TLS settings for
individual MTAs in a possibly long chain of mixed or no encryption before a
message reaches you.
