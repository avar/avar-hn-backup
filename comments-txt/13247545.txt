Yes, which is fair enough, and personally I think that's fine. With odds like
that you'll still get people to sign up as astronauts, and it'll be easier to
advance the science. In the grand scheme of things it's silly to worry about
those deaths and not say death from traffic accidents.

The real issue was that that's not how NASA presented it outwardly. I doubt
that teacher that blew up with Challenger was told about her odds of surviving
in those terms.

As human launch vehicles go I think the shuttle's reliability was fine. The
reason I called it a death machine is that if you make a vehicle that explodes
1% of the time you better advertise that pretty thoroughly before people step
on board. NASA didn't.
