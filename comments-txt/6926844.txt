Thinking people in advance when you're asking them and not expecting them to do
something always struck me as a bit rude. It gives off the implicit expectation
that they're going to do as you ask, and you might as well thank them in
advance since them agreeing to do what you're asking is just a formality.

Personally I just express how much they'd be helping me if they did what I'm
asking and how much I'd appreciate it instead.
