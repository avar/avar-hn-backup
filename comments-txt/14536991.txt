No, it's not fraud. Yes the car is now worth €11000, but it's not taxed on its
ticket price, it's taxed on what it is. It's a car, and a car includes seats, a
car stereo (albeit now a very expensive one), an engine etc.

Nobody's trying to undervalue the car as costing €1,000 with a €10,000 stereo,
that would be fraud.

The point is that by introducing differences in what sort of taxes you have to
pay for certain products you trivially open yourself up to legal tax evasion in
the form of simply bundling higher cost items as part of products in lower tax
categories.

Perhaps a better example: Let's say you have a 200% tax on cylindrical metal
tubes, but a 10% tax on bicycles. A lot of people would now legally import
bicycle frames, cut them apart, and evade the import fees without the
authorities being able to do anything about it. There's nothing illegal about
buying a bicycle frame, and there's nothing illegal about cutting apart your
bicycle and re-using it for parts.
