While Wikipedia (especially the English version) has its problems. That
statement is an exaggeration.

You're very likely to run into these issues if you contribute to certain
topics. Examples include living persons, video game characters, some piece of
software you wrote, or anything else that's not very notable, controversial or
hard to find references for.

However for the vast majority of topics this isn't an issue. If you're just
writing about a place, landmark, some historical character, a scientific
discipline or any of the topics that make up ~80% of the actual content on
Wikipedia you're not going to have your article listed for deletion.
