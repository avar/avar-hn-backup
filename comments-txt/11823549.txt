To be fair to the layperson in the case of SpaceX they're not making it any
better. It's called the "Falcon Heavy" now, but it used to officially be
"Falcon 9 Heavy". If they didn't want it to be confused with a minor
reconfiguration of the "Falcon 9" they couldn't have done worse.

Ditto with "Dragon" and "Crew Dragon".
