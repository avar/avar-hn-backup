Is it possible to go outside the bounds of what a typical international airport
looks like today? E.g. no security screenings so people can pretty much just
walk on the plane like it's a train station?

That would mean you don't need space for restaurants, or lots of space for
people to pool as they're waiting past security.

It would be very interesting to experiment with changes like that and see how
it would look.

Edit: There's now an entire discussion downthread about how airports did and
didn't look like before 9/11.

That misses the point of what I'm asking, which I'll rephrase. I'm asking as a
simulation game, how customizable is this? E.g. in in SimCity 2000 it initially
looks like you can do anything, but really you can't design something that
doesn't look & function either like an American suburb or car-centric Los
Angeles. There's no way to construct something that looks & functions remotely
like the city of Venice in SimCity.

Similarly in this game, can you really design your own airport that works
anyway you want from scratch? Or are you just placing all the pieces in your
typical international airport in different places on the board, while the NPCs
walk in some pre-determined route from parking, to checkin, to security etc.

There's nothing that appears in the very brief trailer that suggests that it
isn't highly constrained in the same way SimCity is. But I'd love to know if
that's really the case.
