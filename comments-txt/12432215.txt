You're just misunderstanding the parent post. He mentioned that the Tesla is
tax beneficial because it's electric and the Mercedes selling at around the
same price isn't because of its weight.

These two statements are not mutually exclusive.

In The Netherlands cars are taxed on multiple factors[1] including CO^2
emission, type, and very significantly on weight.

In Tesla's case the weight is being heavily offset by the lack of CO^2
emissions, whereas the Mercedes gets all the taxes of a normal gasoline car and
the weight tax on top of that.
