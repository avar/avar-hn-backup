Obviously it's implied that if public science funding is going to demand that
researchers use only openly available journals, that the rules for the funding
itself also be adjusted to disregard the impact of these "high impact journals"
for the purposes of preferentially allocating funding.

What do you imagine is going to happen? That public support of science is going
to drop to zero because funding bodies forgot to update two of their internal
rules, and instead just updated one, thereby creating a dependency relationship
that was impossible to satisfy?
