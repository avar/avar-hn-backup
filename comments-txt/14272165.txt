This is obviously just some guy's mostly throwaway code, but FWIW it's got the
type of comments I don't find useful at all when reading code. I.e. comments
that purely duplicate what can be trivially inferred from code:

    # retrieve data
    data = json.loads(request_until_succeed(url))

Not ambiguous, but better done by just naming the function in such a way that
it's obvious that it's the thing retrieving the data. And:

    num_processed = 0   # keep a count on how many we've processed

Is another example of a comment that doesn't compliment the code, but just
distracts the reader from information they could equally, more accurately &
more briefly have gotten from reading the corresponding code.
