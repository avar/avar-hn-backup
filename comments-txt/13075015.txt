You've confused autoconf with automake. The output from autoconf is just a list
of variables that are sourced by your handwritten Makefile, which you can
supply yourself if you don't feel like executing autoconf.

It's automake that writes your Makefile for you, but you can just skip using
that. E.g. the Git project uses autoconf optionally but not automake.
