Let's say a Russian company opens up a chain of coffee shops in the US, has
surveillance cameras for theft prevention, keeps various records on its
customers etc.

Now the Russian government issues a warrant to demand data from the US
subsidiary. Do you think that US jurisdiction should have no say in the matter?

If the Russians compelled their US subsidiary to hand over the data in
violation of US law, how long do you think they'd be allowed to operate in the
US?

The end result of this US overreach will be trade wars and the further rise of
national enclaves of the Internet. I'd argue that that's not in anyone's long
term interests, least alone the US's.
