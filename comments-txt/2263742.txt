I just checked and I have 2500 contacts just my virtue of using GMail for
mailing list. I probably care about less than 100 of those.

There's things like contacts for every Debian and CPAN bug I've ever filed,
contacts for people who change their E-Mail address every day due to using some
wildcard catch + script to generate them etc.
