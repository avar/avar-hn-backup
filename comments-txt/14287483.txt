I was very actively involved in MediaWiki development & Wikimedia ops (less so
though) in 2004-2006 back when IIRC there were just 1-4 paid Wikimedia
employees.

It was a very different time, and the whole thing was run much more like a
typical open source project.

I think the whole project has gone in completely the wrong direction since
then. Wikipedia itself is still awesome, but what's not awesome is that the
typical reader / contributor experience is pretty much the same as it was in
2005.

Moreover, because of the growing number of employees & need for revenue the
foundation's main goal is still to host a centrally maintained site that must
get your pageviews & donations directly.

The goal of Wikipedia should be to spread the content as far & wide as
possible, the way OpenStreetMap operates is a much better model. Success should
be measured as a function of how likely any given person is to see factually
accurate content sourced from Wikipedia, and it shouldn't matter if they're
viewing it on some third party site.

Instead it's still run as one massive monolithic website, and it's still hard
to get any sort of machine readable data out of it. This IMO should have been
the main focus of Wikimedia's development efforts.
