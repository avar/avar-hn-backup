Well, can you name some examples of programs you think GNU really maintains? It
has always been an umbrella project, they haven't employed any developers for
over a decade now.

While Emacs, GCC and coreutils are more historically "GNU" than say GNOME the
vast majority of GNU projects almost from the very beginning has been donated
code or projects that otherwise fell under the GNU umbrella.
