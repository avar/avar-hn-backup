Isn't unstable what you want to use?

The reason it's called "testing" is because it's a branch of Debian that's "in
testing for stable". IIRC packages have to be 2 weeks in unstable without bugs
before migrating to testing.

So it's explicitly not a bleeding edge release, but a preparation release for
the next stable, which is why testing since late-2016 or so hasn't been getting
any new major releases, it's been undergoing release prep.

Maybe there should be a sixth branch of Debian between unstable and testing
that doesn't slow down the migration of packages bug-free for 2 weeks from
unstable around release, but that seems like a lot of maintenance burden to
impose on Debian.
