That's not how it works. The US also relies on the ability to promptly respond
to a first strike, which say the UK does not.

What I'm pointing out is that you've conflated two things. Just because one
aspect of your deterrence is the ability to launch your land-based ICBMs within
30 minutes, that doesn't mean that the inability to do so (e.g. because you
don't know who struck you) means that you're out of options.

Besides, there's no way someone could amass enough SLBMs in the Pacific to take
out two aspects of the US's nuclear triad without the US knowing who owns those
submarines.
