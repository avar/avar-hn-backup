One of the inherent fallacies in your initial comment that I didn't address,
but which you've brought up here: Nobody makes anything the lingua franca, it's
something that happens organically.

I'm sure you're as aware as I am why English is the current lingua franca. It's
mostly a historical accident, and it's what we've got.

Whether the lingua franca might be English, Chinese or whatever is unrelated to
your initial comment, which is what I was replying to.

There you were proposing that everyone should learn some artificial language
for international communication. I think this is a bad idea for the reasons I
stated above.

Now instead of defending your argument that we should all use some constructed
language you're off on a digression about why English and not Chinese, both of
which are natural languages.
