This is literally how pretty much every daemon process works on Unix systems.
You don't log in and tail /var/log/apache/access.log.{1..N} where N is the
number of threads/processes. You just tail /var/log/apache/access.log which all
of them write to by virtue of PIPE_BUF semantics.

Having to tail N logs where N is some unknown number of processes is what's
making your life harder for no reason. That's what O_APPEND and PIPE_BUF are
for.

I really don't see how any of this is relevant to the original point of having
"log" files. Now you're talking about DB transaction logs and blockchains,
which really don't need to have their nuances implemented in terms of POSIX
file semantics. They can just have a single process that manages those
expectations.

Everyone's expectations don't have to be implemented on the filesystem level,
particularly when those expectations inherently involve locking writes and
retry loops.
