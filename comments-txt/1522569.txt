The difference is that it's easy to look primary source material for obscure
cities, animals and flowers. But not for some random guy who blogs.

While I don't agree with some of the policies on the English Wikipedia, you
also have to consider that having articles about anything incurs a long-term
maintenance cost on the project. This especially true when the articles are
about living persons or controversial subjects.

People are always complaining about Wikipedia because some obscure subject they
personally care about didn't make the cut. Meanwhile there are literally
millions of very useful encyclopedia articles on topics that unquestionably
belong in an encyclopedia.

It's that sort of content that Wikipedia mainly caters to.
