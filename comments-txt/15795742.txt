Yes, of course the rich are going to end up paying for BI no matter what. At
some point the government is just taking $1000 out of your wallet and handing
it back as BI, depending on your income.

But this is explicitly what the proponents of BI want. It's as much about the
optics as who pays for it. I.e. the idea is to create a program that draws its
political support from everyone getting paid a check, similar to how Roosevelt
enacted social security to include all citizens, even those who were
millionaires and had no need for it.

Which is what sets it apart from Negative Income Tax.
