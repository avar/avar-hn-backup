Oh yes, Google has explicitly stated that they track stuff like this. I was
just replying to the "it looks to be derived from nothing more than is stored
in your inbox" comment by moultano. Which is obviously incorrect, and Google
even states so in their introduction video.

It'd be interesting to what degree using GMail over IMAP v.s. over the GMail
web interface affects the heuristics of this new feature.
