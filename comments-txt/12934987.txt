Whatever you think of Trump's policies, the US portion of world GDP has been
going down since the 1950s. How long do you think it's tenable for the US to
maintain its current commitments? When it's down to 20% of world GDP? 10%, 5%?

The US is still coasting on foreign policy that was essentially made in 1945
after WWII. There's just no way that policy can be maintained indefinitely.

Trump has made comments to the effect that he'd like to lay the foundations of
a new type of foreign policy that'll last for decades to come. Whatever you
think of his plans I think it's clear that the US can't maintain these foreign
entanglements indefinitely, and will need to distribute some of the load to
their current allies.
