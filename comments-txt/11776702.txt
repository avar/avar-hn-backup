They haven't? According to what? I just looked this up for Milan real quick:

SF had 350k people in 1900, and 800k in 2010[1], a growth of ~2.3x. Milan had
550k people in 1900 and 1.3 million in 2010[2], a growth of ~2.35x.

I don't understand how you think SF is the exception in this example. Both of
these cities have had similar population growth, Milan slightly more actually.
It seems the difference is that Milan decided to build up.
