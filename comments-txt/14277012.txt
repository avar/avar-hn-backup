His numbers look fine, but I think the assumptions are false.

This seems to assume that the earth is also cube shaped like a hypothetical
50ft^3 blast furnace, instead of a sphere (or oblate spheroid before anyone
out-pedants me).

It also seems to assume that a 50ft^3 blast furnace contains energy equivalent
to 50ft^3 of molten mantle. If you look at diagrams of blast furnaces you can
see that a relatively tiny part of them is actually molten material.

Not being able to find numbers on the stored joules of industrial blast
furnaces, I'm just going to just state that 50ft^3 of mantle has a crapload
more potential energy than 50ft^3 of blast furnace, most of which is air,
equipment & empty space, not molten material.

He is right that there's at least as much energy stored in the earth as he's
saying, but it's going to be a crapload more than that.

The insides of blast furnaces are also significantly colder than the average
temperature of the mantle.
