This article from 1990 in the NYT tries to account for the cost of banning
CFC's[1]. At worst it's a few hundred billion USD.

We've spent way more than that on CO^2 via the Kyoto accords etc. Of course the
problem isn't solved, but that's because it's a way bigger problem. We've acted
even more on CO^2 than CFC's, but the problem of CFC's was much smaller and
easier to solve.
