This whole thread including this comment feels like people who haven't ever
been to The Netherlands making suggestions that make no sense for the cycling
culture here.

So firstly as has been covered in other comments here, cyclists in The
Netherlands don't want to wear helmets for their daily commuting, it doesn't
solve any sort of safety problem for them when you factor in the inconvenience
they cause.

Secondly even if they did most bicycle chains here are over an inch thick, not
something you can thread through a bicycle helmet.

Sure you could carry some extra wire just to lock the helmet to the bike, but
that gets you even further down the road of making a bunch of special
accommodations to solve a problem that doesn't exist in the first place.
