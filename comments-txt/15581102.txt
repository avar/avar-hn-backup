Even if that weren't the case, it says:

    [The Congress shall have Power] To
    regulate Commerce with foreign Nations,
    and among the several States, and with
    the Indian Tribes;

I.e. not that the Federal government must regulate interstate commerce, merely
that it has the power to do that, and even if it said that the commerce must be
regulated it could still be regulated to the effect that you couldn't e.g. sell
across state lines.

But yes, the reason the regulation is different for alcohol than for other
goods is ostensibly the 21st.
