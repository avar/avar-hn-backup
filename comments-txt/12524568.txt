What do you think the risk is? That some sociopath gains access to the perl6
repo and replaces all the code with a shellscript that "sudo rm -rf /"'s?

Sure, that's possible, but good contributors will vastly outnumber bad
contributors, and such a person's commit access would be revoked instantly.
There's still code review for everything, and such a change would not go
unnoticed.

Just look at Wikipedia. That's the equivalent of a publically writeable repo
and hasn't turned into a total shitshow as a result.

As the Perl 6 ecosystem demonstrates you get way more out of inclusiveness than
being paranoid about some hypothetical bad actor getting access to your repo.
