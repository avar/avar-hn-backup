The biggest revelation to me in that article, which I feel should be
highlighted more, is that the Red Cross provides almost zero information about
how it spends its money.

It refuses to provide more than very vague information about how the money was
spent in Haiti (information like "35% of $488 million on shelters"), with no
specific details about what projects they spent the money on, how those
projects went etc.

When the author challenged the general counsel of the Red Cross to provide more
detailed information ("because clearly you must have it") he just gave her some
evasive boilerplate spiel about having provided the summary information he'd
provided already.

How can anyone donate to a charity that's so stunningly opaque about how it
spends its money?
