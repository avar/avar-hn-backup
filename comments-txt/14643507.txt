How is the US not improving as well? Renewable energy usage went up from ~9% to
~13% from 2002 to 2013[1]. The growth in photovoltaics continues[2]. The
portion of electric cars as part of the fleet is going up[3] etc.

It is true that the US could be doing better, but it's not doing the opposite
of what China is doing when it comes to energy & environmental improvements.
