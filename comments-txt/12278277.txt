It's not specifically a powerlifting program, but it includes all the
powerlifting moves, and I started with it: http://stronglifts.com/5x5/

If you're a beginner the difference really isn't going to matter.

It's good because, as opposed to Starting Strength, the material is all free
online, it's all one web page with instructional videos, and the guy has mobile
apps you can use for free.
