Here's a thought experiment you can use to clarify the difference between good
& evil: What would each side in a conflict do if they had overwhelming power?

We have plenty of evidence to see what the US would do. When they defeated
Germany & Japan at the end of WWII did they enslave their people? Use their
nuclear advantage to conquer new lands and colonize them? No, they rebuilt
their economies and tried to ensure that they had stable governments & trading
partners.

What do you think ISIS would do with exclusive use of nuclear weapons? How
about Iraq under Saddam etc? Do you think Hamas would be equally deterred by
Israelis using their children as human shields as Israelis are by Hamas using
theirs for that purpose?

Of course good & evil isn't black and white, the western world does a lot of
bad stuff. But it's just as brainwashed to think that just because all sides
cause some civilian casualties to think that everyone's morally equal, as it is
to think that the US is some altruistic knight in shining armor that can do no
wrong.
