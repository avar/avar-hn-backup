    > They have absolutely no interest in conservation.

Who's "they"? Are you saying that wild game reserves just categorically don't
work and can't preserve wild populations of animals?

Do you only think that about Africa (why?) or e.g. also for U.S. National Parks
or other areas where you can buy hunting tags?

Full disclosure: I don't hunt, I have no interested in doing so. I'm just
perplexed that solutions that seem to work in the west to align economic
incentives with conservation aren't being applied in Africa.

And furthermore, when you ask about it you don't get any sort of specific
answers, but just out of hand dismissive answers seemingly based on motivated
reasoning without any explanation of why certain systems would work for animals
A in country X, but not animals B in country Y.
