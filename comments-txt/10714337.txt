Plans for building a birdhouse are completely incomparable to what the parent
is talking about. This would be like me having an "open source" birdhouse
design where the birdhouse is made of glued-together Intel™ processors.

Sure I've opened the schematics, but unlike a birdhouse made from wood you have
zero chance of being able to build one from scratch on your own, or sourcing
the Intel™ processors from another vendor.

This is the same reason for why if I release the binary of a program produced
with a secret compiler as "open source" I'll be laughed at, it completely goes
against the spirit of the thing, which is that anyone should be able to change
any part of the thing I've released.

It's good that they're doing this. But it's completely incomparable to actual
fully open source hardware.
