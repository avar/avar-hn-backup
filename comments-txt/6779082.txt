Using "DMZ" in this context is very confusing, in common usage it means the
exact opposite of what you intended.

A lot of home routers have a "DMZ" feature that gives the device you put in the
DMZ full access to the outside internet, but restricts their access to other
hosts on the local network.

It's typically used for gaming machines when you can't be bothered to forward a
lot of ports individually, I have a gaming console in a "DMZ" on my network so
I can play games online without fuss.
