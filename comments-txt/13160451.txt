You grossly overestimate the relevance of your own experience to the discussion
of modern nuclear weapons. Those explosions were all either airbursts,
purposefully designed to avoid fallout, or very low yield weapons when compared
to modern weaponry.

All of which is of very little relevance to discussing modern nukes intended to
cause fallout.
