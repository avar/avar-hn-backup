Sorry about that. Like aylons suggested in a side comment I have the "Cloud To
Butt Plus" extension installed. This is the first time it gets me into trouble.

FWIW it doesn't change the submitted text directly, but I edited a spelling
error in my comment which changed "iCloud" to "iButt".

There's also a an extension that replaces "God" with "Nicolas Cage" that I
recommend :)
