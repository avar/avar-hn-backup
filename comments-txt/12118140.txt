Could you elaborate on what you think the current deployment of the X-37 has to
do timeline wise with the cancellation of the shuttle program?

After Challenger the Air Force cancelled its plan to use the shuttle for
satellites and opted instead for more conventional boosters.

I can't remember whether it was after Challenger or Columbia but didn't NASA
also stop returning payloads from orbit from safety reasons after one of those
disasters?

I'm sure the Air Force is using the X-37 for something, although they're not
saying what, but I don't see how whatever it is has to do with the timeline of
the cancellation of the shuttle program.
