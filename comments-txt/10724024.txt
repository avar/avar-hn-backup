Yes I realize what it takes, but as Feynman quipped "nature cannot be fooled".
At some point the piecemeal dilution of what we actually need to do will come
back and bite us badly.

No amount of negotiation between the hypothetical scientist and the bureaucrats
about not cutting down the last tree on Easter Island that doesn't 100% go in
favor of the scientist will come out well. The trees will still be extinct.
