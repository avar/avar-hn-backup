This advice is usually "Don't (only) invest in the industry you're employed
in".

See e.g. the dot-com bubble and how people who worked in IT and had invested
their money mainly in IT were screwed, whereas it wasn't so bad if you just got
fired and say invested in an S&P 500 index fund.

But yes, investing only in your employer is a particularly bad version of that.
