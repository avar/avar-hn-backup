The flock() method is preferable when you don't need to use NFS because as you
say it'll automatically clean the lock up if the process holding it dies.

This gets rid of all the edge cases with stale locks in one fell swoop.

But as you point out if you want to do this e.g. over NFS you should create a
file, but then you need to deal with stale locks.

If you can at all avoid that using flock() is generally better.
