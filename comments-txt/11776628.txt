As a non-native English speaker I think this is a horrible idea. So rather than
for us to all communicate in English which is spoken natively by around half a
billion, you'd rather international communication take place in a language
nobody speaks natively?

That seems like a horrible idea. When the lingua franca is some common natively
spoken language at least people who can confidently correct you exist.

Having everyone speak a non-native language would just lead to a regression
towards the mean, and such a language would be much harder to learn than any
existing language because it wouldn't come with a culture. There would be very
few books, movies etc. in that language.
