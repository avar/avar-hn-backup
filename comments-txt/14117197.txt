I'd buy that used too.

You know there are climbing gyms where you're using both dynamic ropes &
carabiners used by thousands of people before you? Those places aren't death
traps.

Ditto mountaineering tours etc. for newbies that usually have every incentive
not to report if they damage some of the equipment.

Carabiners, ropes & the like are tested when they're manufactured. Any damage
likely to damage their structural integrity is usually going to be quite
obvious. E.g. the carabiner won't close, or the rope will look like shit
(although puncturing the core of a rope with crampons can be a subtle
exception).

All other things being equal you're likely to be better off with brand new
equipment, but you're also probably way better with used equipment where you
spent that extra $500 you saved on some safety course & expert instruction,
than skipping that and buying a brand new rope & carabiners.

Failing to properly secure a knot to a used carabiner is a way more likely
cause of death than the carabiner itself failing.
