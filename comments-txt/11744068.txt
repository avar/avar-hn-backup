Let's not assume that correlation is causation here. One explanation is that
female primary caregivers face systematic discrimination their male peers don't
face.

Another is that female primary caregivers, more so than their male
counterparts, lose interest in focusing on work after they have a child, and
thus fall into the rut of a lower performing employee that inevitably gets paid
less.

I don't know which it is. Are their studies that try to find out?
