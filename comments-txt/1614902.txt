I clearly shouldn't have underestimated Michigan's climate. I haven't been to
Bergen, but I've been in Minneapolis in winter (it was -20 °C). I wouldn't have
cycled there due to the bad infrastructure, not due to the weather.

Anyway, aside from those two cities the main reason people don't cycle has been
shown time and time again to be lack of infrastructure, not the weather. Just
look at other places with the same climate as The Netherlands, or Bergen.
Clearly the common factor isn't the weather.

It's also a much bigger factor than people imagine. I've lived in Iceland which
often has these sort of glassy ice conditions an -5 °C, and I'd much prefer it
to otherwise equivalent weather at 20 °C somewhere else.

The cold allows you to push harder without being sweaty, and I've found that in
mixed terrain cycling on ice with studded tires is a lot safer than on no ice.
It's a lot easier to slip on loose gravel than it is to slip on ice when your
tires have a dozen nails sticking into the ice.
