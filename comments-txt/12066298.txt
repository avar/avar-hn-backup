As others have pointed out already Argentina is less hospitable than Canada,
but no, that wasn't what I was getting at.

The chart shows that give or take some variations due to political borders,
regional climates etc. the human population is pretty much distributed like a
bell curve as a function of latitude.

I.e. despite all our technology and adoption skills very few people live in
Northern Greenland or in the middle of the Sahara. Climate change might change
existing population centers more towards either of those extremes with bad
results.
