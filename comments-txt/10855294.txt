    > I'm not advocating 14 years; I think 28-56 is fair.

As I said I don't agree with the current state of copyright and think it should
probably be much shorter, but it's interesting that discussions on this matter
are rarely backed up with data. Why do you prefer 28-56 over 14, or 28-56 over
18-46?

Before you mentioned that "every artist on this list is dead" as if it were
patently absurd for copyright to survive the author. Maybe it is, but to use my
previous example why would a talented author is his 80s with young children
write another novel if that were the case instead of going into the real estate
business?

You have to factor in movie studios being reluctant to base their works on
public domain work because it makes it harder to create a franchise out of it.
With a big hit like Starship Troopers being in the public domain nothing's
stopping some other studio from releasing Starship Troopers 2, or selling
action figures with that name etc.

It's sometimes advantageous that a work you want to use is copyrighted, because
that means you can secure exclusive rights to publish a derived work based on
it.
