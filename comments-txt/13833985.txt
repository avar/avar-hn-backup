It's way easier for someone to hack up an acceptable new UI for org-mode
(whatever that looks like) using the existing underlying Emacs org-mode code/
runtime than it is to hack up a new UI and completely replace all the Emacs
code & org-mode.

You can run Emacs headless, it has C extension support now, your Mac app could
start it headless and communicate with it over a socket or as a network
process. Multiple Emacs modes do this to make Emacs itself talk to other
programs (e.g. mu4e <-> mu, gud <-> gdb), there's no reason you can't do it the
other way around.
