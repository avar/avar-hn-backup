It has taken me several years to get used to using Unix systems through
accumulated casual and professional usage. I used Git for a year or so before I
really started to understand it.

Emacs is like that. You can read the Emacs tutorial in 20 minutes and use it
like a fancy notepad, but true mastery of any complex and powerful system takes
years.
