Why not satisfy the demand? We're not worried about the demand for chickens
making them extinct, but if chickens were still delicious but it was illegal to
trade them we'd surely be in the same situation with chickens facing certain
extinction.

Why isn't that an acceptable solution for elephants? Developed western
countries sell expensive hunting tags for large animals.

Are elephants stuck in some economical limbo where it's too expensive to raise
them but too tempting to kill them in the wild? Or is profitable culling simply
rejected out of hand for moral reasons that aren't applied to similar animals
in the west (e.g. bears).
