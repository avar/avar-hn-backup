Funny how a lot of Americans think banning chewing gum is oppressive but don't
realize the similarity in the USA entirely banning Kinder Surprise eggs.

Lots of arbitrary stuff is banned in a lot of countries. Singapore just thought
the littering cons of gum outweighed the pros.

Note that stuff like nicotine gum and other "therapeutic" chewing gum is still
allowed, they just don't allow the candy that leads to littering.

And honestly looking around in a lot of cities where the entirety of downtown
is slowly growing into a white blob composed of little individual pieces of
squashed chewing gum I don't blame them.
