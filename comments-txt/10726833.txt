How does Plan 9 deal the equivalent of this append-only pattern potentially
causing corruption on Unix if you have multiple writers and the writes are
larger than PIPE_BUF (4k by default on Linux)?

Most users of this pattern (concurrent updates to log files) get away with it
because their updates are smaller than 4k, but if you're trying to write
something as big as an E-Mail with this pattern you can trivially get
interleaved writes resulting in corruption.
