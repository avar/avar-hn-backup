Right, I was overly simplifying. I meant to say a 120 sh ton MLC-calculated
weight, not a vehicle that's exactly 120 tons since as the article goes into
the class needs to take into account axle count etc.

What I don't understand is your claim that "you could just as well consider
them metric tons". These are short tons with caveats, i.e. the eventual number
depends on more than just the raw weight, but the raw weight is one aspect of
the calculation.

So if you were to make that calculation on the basis of metric instead of lbs
how aren't you going to introduce something like a 10% error in the MLC you
come up with?
