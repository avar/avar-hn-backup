I wouldn't donate either for those reasons, but one thing to keep in mind is
that the codebase running reddit is open source: http://github.com/reddit/
reddit

They pushed to the public Git in a month, but the donations users are making
will go towards improving that codebase. It can be used to deploy your own (and
hopefully more scalable) version of reddit.
