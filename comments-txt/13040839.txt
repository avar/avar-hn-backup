Have these friends of yours tried talking to e.g. a powerlifting or
bodybuilding coach? It's pretty easy to get on a structured low-effort diet to
gain weight, and muscle mass with some exercise thrown in.

Getting above 1500 calories isn't some desperate effort of "spend[ing] every
waking moment stuffing in high-calorie food". It's a couple of protein shakes a
day that take you a couple of minutes to prepare & slurp down.

Eating enough can be a very difficult logistical problem, but not at the 1500
calorie level, but at something like a >5000 calorie level where you're a
professional strongman or powerlifter, or someone like Michael Phelps eating
8000 calories a day.
