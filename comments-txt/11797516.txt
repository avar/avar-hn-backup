The first thing I looked through, the pedometer/ directory, has a project that
itself may be <500 lines, but is using compressed versions of JS libraries like
highcharts.js & jquery.js.

Don't you think including huge external libraries like that defeats the spirit
of showing things that are 500 lines or less?
