I've never had to file US taxes so this might be a stupid question, but how
exactly are the people in your example worse off with ReadyReturn?

Isn't ReadyReturn just e.g. summing up their reported wages for the return,
which they'd need to do accurately anyway if they were filling it in from
scratch?

Yes, if you have a pre-filled in tax return nothing that the government doesn't
know about & which might be deductible is going to be on there, but that's the
situation you were in already, wasn't it? Now you'll have more time to fill
that out, instead of doing menial work like manually summing up your monthly
payslips to arrive at a yearly total.

Or is ReadyReturn somehow structurally flawed in allowing you to either file
for a simplified pre-filled in return with no amendments, or having to do an
old-style return from scratch?

When I file my taxes in The Netherlands all the concerns you've raised are
addressed through a system where most of the information is pre-filled in. I.e.
they know how much I make so that number is on there, but they might not know
about a few other deductibles, those are established through a series of
questions you answer.

E.g. "do you own a house" -> "what type of mortgage" -> "do you pay a land use
fee?" -> that's a deductible (to cite one made-up example).

Most importantly it establishes a workflow where if something is a deductible
(unless it's something really obscure, manual returns still exist), it's going
to be on the online tax form.

So even if the initial implementation is bad just establishing that process is
worthwhile, because there'll be political pressure to make it better next year,
and the year after that.
