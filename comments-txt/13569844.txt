Where I live I've been going to the same gym for 3 years. I show up, squat,
deadlift, etc. The conversations I have with people are about whether the power
rack is free, how long they're going to take etc.

Just how do you get into conversations at your gym where you don't feel like
you belong because of your decisions about how to handle real estate purchases?
