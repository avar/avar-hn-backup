If you only make the shoes for the left leg you're still doing your actual job,
just not all of it.

Disabling half the buttons on a page is an active act of sabotage.

Peaceful protests for software engineers have the problem that in most software
companies, if everyone used the age old "you're not allowed to strike" tactic
of conspiring to call in sick, most likely the software would continue to work
just fine, since everything is automated.

Of course the system would eventually break down, but likely after the
employees lost their patience for the protest, by which point the company could
have brought in replacements to keep the shop running.
