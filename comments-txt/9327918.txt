Same here, so [shameless plug] I wrote http://goosegoosego.com which is just a
redirector for Google/DDG which you can trivially run locally. It defaults to
Google, and you can search DDG via !ddg

It gives you the advantage of having access to the !Bang syntax (https://
duckduckgo.com/bang.html), while providing IMO better search results via Google
by default.
