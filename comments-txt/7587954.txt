Having cheap & sustainable launch capabilities is going to be a much bigger
deal in the long term than brute forcing your way to the Moon as a one-off by
spending 1/20th of the US GDP over the period of a few years.

After we have cheap & reusable rockets we'll have much larger leaps in space
travel in the next 40 years than we have since the 40 years since Apollo.
