I'm pointing out that the states forbidding commerce across state lines is not
a violation of the commerce clause per-se. Rather it's a violation of how the
federal government has chosen to use the rights it's granted by the commerce
clause.

I.e. it's just the academic point that it's not inevitable that the Federal
government uses the power of the CC to enforce free trade between states,
that's just how it's chosen to implement it.

I.e. there could be an alternate timeline of the US where the CC enforces the
ability of individual states to impose interstate tariffs up to some threshold,
similar to how the EU manages agriculture quotas within the single market.
