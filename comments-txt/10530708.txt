I think both you and the parent I was replying to are guilty of the same
fallacy: transposing economic value on the individual level to society at
large.

People at large want to have kids, they want to not die from treatable
illnesses. Even when those two goals are at odds with optimal economic
realities societies will still try to attain them, because we build societies
and economies as a means to an end to attain our goals, we don't live our lives
purely to satisfy economic efficiencies.

We're an organism that's the product of billions of years of evolution, all
organisms try to spread their genes to the next generation. To say that you're
better off with one child who's a collage graduate than two who aren't might be
true economically, but ignores what's fundamentally driving us all forward as
an organism.

Does anyone really think the primacy of reproduction can be superseded by some
clever economic theories?
