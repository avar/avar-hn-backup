I spent all of 5 hours in a new Subaru Outback I rented this summer and wasn't
impressed.

I could set the cruise control to a certain speed and it would normally slow
down if there was congestion, which was very nice.

But it wouldn't work at bends in the road, because the system was seemingly
just directly ahead line-of-sight. I wanted to see if it would slow down itself
in that situation before I had to slam the breaks, it would have plowed into
the much slower-moving car ahead of me.

So my experience is that while these systems help in bumper-to-bumper traffic
on congested highways they're still to dangerous to rely on.
