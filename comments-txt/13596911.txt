> Yes, I would prefer a US hegemony over an ISIS hegemony. The comparison
itself is ridiculous.

Of course the comparison is ridiculous. That's my whole point.

But this is the comparison the grandparent I'm replying to is making. I.e. that
the U.S. bombs some countries while being concerned about civilian casualties,
and terrorists respond with something like the 9/11 attacks where they're
explicitly trying to inflict civilian casualties, and somehow this should make
it less clear who the good & evil actors are, as opposed to more clear.

> But saying that the US has not used its military strength for its own benefit
and at the expense of the people of other countries is ridiculous.

I'm struggling to see how you can read my comment and conclude that I'm trying
to make that point, but needless to say, you're fighting a strawman.
