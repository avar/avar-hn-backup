That's why people say it reduces "governmental power", not "law enforcement
power". The "government" includes the organization that issues the fiat
currency that you use.

You could argue that the increase in law enforcement power would offset the
decrease in power from not being able to issue fiat currency, but that would
mostly be a silly line of argument to pursue.
