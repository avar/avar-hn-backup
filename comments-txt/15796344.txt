I replied to most of this in a side-thread at https://news.ycombinator.com/

But I'd like to elaborate a bit here. UBI is not identical to NIT because the
difference is marketing, not math. Most of the electorate's basis for
evaluating a given policy is not to perform a mathematical comparison of two
systems and checking whether they yield the same results. How something is done
is as important in politics as what gets done.

Which is why, as I've pointed out, BI isn't like NIT at all. The difference is
how the idea is going to get sold to the public, not what each taxpayer is
going to end up contributing to the system as a function of their income.
