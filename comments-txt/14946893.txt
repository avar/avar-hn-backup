Whenever flood control in The Netherlands is discussed, it's worth looking at
this detailed elevation map:

http://www.floodmap.net/Elevation/CountryElevationMap/?ct=NL

The elevation profile of the entire country is one where the coast is much
higher than sealevel, and then gradually slopes downwards to bits of the
interior that are entirely landlocked, but are say 1 meter below sealevel. In
other words we have pockets of land that are below sealevel, but they're
surrounded by and protected by land that's not.

The facts on the ground are very different from claims being made by a sibling
comment that "we are ALREADY beneath sea level!". This is why the NYT article
is talking about "reservoirs for when the seas and rivers spill over" and "to
let water in, where possible". Managing the water is largely about protecting
these pockets that are below sealevel.
