They arrived in a period where the weather was particularly good, and proceeded
to just practice the same sort of farming that they were used to in Scandinavia
and Iceland.

But there's no indication that they were actively contacting the native
population to learn their hunting techniques, such as how to build kayaks and
hunt marine mammals, or venture under the ice to gather mussels[1] etc.

Which, to bring this thread around to the original point being made, doesn't
suggest that "Greenland [was] uninhabitable", just that a population of people
had arrived that didn't know how to make use of it.

You might be able to transport a tribe from the middle of the Amazon to
northern Greenland today and them not being able to survive, or the other way
around. That doesn't mean that either place is uninhabitable.
