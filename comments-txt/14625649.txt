Even if a lot of the vulnerable machines still run insecure software there's
just no reason why they all need to be networked as they are now. E.g. medical
machines at the NHS running Windows recently got ransomware'd.

There's no intrinsic reason for why these machines need to be connected to even
an internal network other than lazyness prioritizing convenience over security.
