I think the conviction should stand because it's pretty ridiculous to go around
pardoning dead people convicted under laws we now view as having been wrong.
Where should it end? Should the UK start hunting down and posthumously
pardoning some of the convicts it shipped off to other continents for petty
crimes during the Victorian era?

Unless you go and systematically posthumously pardon people how are you serving
justice by only pardoning historical persons famous enough to have enough of a
modern following to petition the modern-era government on their behalf?
