What's wrong here is that he's refusing to work with a willing upstream. It
would be much better for everyone if he submitted patches to Google to allow
everyone using Chrome to optionally turn off these tracking features.

Instead he's needlessly forking the project to "bring a lot of publicity to my
person and my homepage". That's not being a good open source citizen.
