I'm listening. Are you? The parent of this thread quoted: "And I did not chip
in ten grand to seed a first investment round to build value for a Facebook
acquisition."

If you didn't chip in ten grand of seed money for that purpose why didn't you
make that part of the deal then?

There are no non-legal aspects of financial transactions. When you give someone
money they're going to try to retain that money and not give it back to you to
the best of their legal ability. There really isn't a non-legal aspect involved
in it unless you're a sucker who's willing to get screwed over.

Who cares about the value of their reputation when they've been bought by
Facebook for some undisclosed value? Surely that's worth more to them than
their reputation, seeing as they now have enough money to never work again with
the people who'd care about their reputation.
