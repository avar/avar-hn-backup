The reason I'm not buying the PSRV is that it's really hard to figure out if
it'll even work for me vis-a-vis the tracking camera.

I have a projector setup, so the PSRV camera has some propriterary cable
running to it that I'd need to buy a third-party extension cord for, and who
knows if that'll work.

Even if I have that I can't find any information on Sony's site about where
it's acceptable to mount the camera relative to where you're standing. Is it
only OK if it's directly in front of you, how about at a 45Â° incline etc?

Then, if I get all of that right I don't have a lot of floor space in front of
the projector (maybe 2x2 meters), they don't say how far you're expected to
move around in the games you can buy.
