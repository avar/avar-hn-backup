Yes, of course some people will hate it so much that they'll boycott the
service, whether it's games with DLC or airlines.

But my point is that a much larger segment of the population just likes to
complain, and if you listen to what they're saying you'll get an inaccurate
picture of reality.

For example, people who complain about the state of seats on airplanes while
choosing not to book "economy plus" or "economy comfort" or whatever it's
called, which often isn't more expensive than the equivalent of one sit-down
meal and a beer at a cheap restaurant.

But those people won't say "listen, all other things being equal I'd prefer a
bit more room, but honestly I'd rather save $40 to put up with a bit of
discomfort to eat at a better restaurant once I land".

Even though that's the description that best matches reality given the data at
hand. Instead they'll go on some tirade about how really they fly so much less
than they used to, meanwhile air travel is increasing all over the world and
we'd have to assume market researchers for all these airlines are idiots
because there's some huge market segment for the taking if they'd only increase
leg room a bit.

Which they'll try, but they'll quickly find out that while people complain
they're really not prepared to pay an extra $40 for it. So here we are.
