I also grew up with subtitles, and I agree they're the best compromise when you
don't understand the dialog. But I never acquired the skill to ignore them once
I understood what was being subtitled at a native level, and I really don't
really understand how anyone could.

The human vision is drawn to quick changes & movement, when you have an
otherwise immobile scene that's mostly just dialog subtitles will pop in & out,
I can't help but focus on them just like I would if something else suddenly
popped into the scene.

If you have words pop into your vision you also can't help but read them, at
least I can't, subconsciously reading the translation and hearing the original
version at the same time is really distracting.

I found the only way to deal with them was to position myself behind some sofa
so I could only watch the top 3/4 of the screen, but of course you miss a big
part of the movie that way.
