Not defending Trump's policies or their feasability, but I have a question
about this:

If the US abolished birthright citizenship and a child were born to Mexican
parents in the U.S. isn't that child eligable for Mexican citizenship?
Birthright citizenship isn't a thing in e.g. Europe and that's how this works
there, it doesn't result in stateless children, it just results in children
needing to be registered in their parent's country of origin.
