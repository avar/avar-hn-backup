When you clone the Git repository and build the package all the utilities come
with manual pages built from DocBook, e.g. for chronic:

    $ man ./chronic.1 | col -b | grep -v ^$ | head -n 12
    CHRONIC(1)                                                                                                                              CHRONIC(1)
    NAME
           chronic - runs a command quietly unless it fails
    SYNOPSIS
           chronic COMMAND...
    DESCRIPTION
           chronic runs a command, and arranges for its standard out and standard error to only be displayed if the command fails (exits nonzero or
           crashes).  If the command succeeds, any extraneous output will be hidden.
           A common use for chronic is for running a cron job. Rather than trying to keep the command quiet, and having to deal with mails containing
           accidental output when it succeeds, and not verbose enough output when it fails, you can just run it verbosely always, and use chronic to
           hide the successful output.
