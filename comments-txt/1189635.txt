As wasteful as the proposed Constellation program was at least it would have
gotten humans out Low Earth Orbit again.

Is Obama's plan for increased commercialization anything more than moving
around the pieces that are already there? Most of the parts for the space
vehicles are already made by subcontractors, aren't they just changing how the
oversight is done?

Even with those rules changed NASA is still going to be responsible for the
astronauts. It'll take years and billions of dollars to man-rate vehicles that
we wouldn't have thought twice about using back in the 70s as long as they
didn't explode on the first couple of test flights.

Maybe money flowing out of the Space Shuttle program will get us there sooner,
but with the US rebooting its space program every time time a new president
takes office I'm starting to think the Chinese are our best hope for getting to
the stars.
