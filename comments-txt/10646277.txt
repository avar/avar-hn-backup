It doesn't make sense to purely think about it in terms of time spent. For
instance I've been unhappy with Mozilla Thunderbird for years now, its
performance is crappy, the search is slow etc. Finally a couple of weeks ago I
took the time to spend two full days setting up mbsync+mu+mu4e+Emacs just the
way I want, the setup is awesome, and my E-Mail no longer annoys me.

Sure in terms of pure time spent I'll probably take years to gain that back,
but there's something to be said about not having a grating sense of annoyance
in your daily life from the tools you use professionally, and that's worth more
than just the time you save.
