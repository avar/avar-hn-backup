It's been a failure in my opinion. The benefits of the patent licensing clause
did not win out over the massive loss of the likes of Apple, the BSDs etc.
shunning GPLv3 software.

It also spurred a lot of rewrites of GPL software. This has been good for the
most part, but the opposite of what the FSF intended.
