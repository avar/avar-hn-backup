To me your comment demonstrates why it's really hard to figure out anything
worthwhile about SEO.

You wrote that code almost 8 years ago[1]. Google and other search engines have
changed a lot since then. Who knows if this has any impact today?

Actually did you even A/B test it at the time? Or just turn it on along with a
bunch of other changes?

It's hard to tell, and there's so much SEO (mis)information out there based on
old anecdotes, and all the players doing A/B testing for this sort of thing on
a big scale keep their data to themselves.
