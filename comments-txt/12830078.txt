Yeah it's going to be really interesting whatever happens.

As a point of clarification. The Independence Party and Progressive Party would
be happy to form a government with each other, they think that overall they did
great, and downplay the corruption that brought down the government.

But they don't have enough following to do it on their own, and all the other
parties they could form with have made commitments of not forming with those
two together.

Although both were deeply involved in the corruption that brought down the
government, the PM was from the Progressives, and it lost a massive following
in the election while the Independence party gained following. So it's
politically untenable to work with the Progressives, but some parties might be
willing to work with the Independence party.

    > Ind(21) + Reg(7) + Bri(4) = 32

This would be possible, and Bright Future isn't ruling it out: http://

But a one party majority in parliament would be really precarious, and it would
be very interesting to see what concessions have to get made.

    > Lef(10) + Pir(10) + Reg(7) + Bri(4) + Soc(3) = 34

This would also be a really interesting combination. The Regeneration party
says they don't want to go into government with the Pirates, but who knows how
much of this is political posturing. I don't think they have any inherent clash
of political issues they couldn't both get over given some negotiation.
