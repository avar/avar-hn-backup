I recommend these videos by Dr. Robert Zubrin and Jeff Greason for some
context: http://www.youtube.com/user/spacevidcast#p/search/7/d9J7Hgnx... http:/

Essentially, NASA has lacked any concrete direction since the 70s, and projects
like Constellation are stupid because they waste a lot of NASA money on
developing NASA's own launch capacity. When NASA should just buy (or pay to
upgrade) existing capacity such as the Delta IV Heavy or Falcon 9 to fit its
needs.

Most importantly, with development of launch capacity moved out of NASA, NASA
will have to specify the ends, not the means. Being the party that sets the
budget, makes the design, and implements the design is a very bad position to
be in.
