Then again, there's no reason why an embedded database can't launch multiple
subprocesses, or talk to itself via a socket for that matter. The same goes for
the storage SQLite uses one file, but an embedded PostgreSQL allocating one
opaque directory would be fine.

The important part is that you'd be able to easily statically link to it and
handle permissions on a by-file basis, instead of PostgreSQL's current
permission model. For all intents and purposes it'd be a larger SQLite
replacement then.
