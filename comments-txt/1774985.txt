A good reason to write tests for seemingly trivial code like that is if you're
implementing an API that others will use. I've re-factored a class that
implemented a public API and been saved by trivial tests that pretty much just
tested getters/setters.

But there's a time and place for everything. I rarely pass 95% test coverage,
the remaining 5% are usually not worth pursuing.
