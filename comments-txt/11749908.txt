I think I did try stuff like that, including mounting / with nodatacow and
other similar options.

I walked away with the impression that btrfs was a powerful tool for certain
use-cases, but definitely not something I'd call a "general purpose" filesystem
given the need to be fairly knowledgeable about its internals to use it for
common desktop use-cases.

To me a general purpose filesystem is something like ext4, it doesn't have
amazing performance, it's not bad either, but generally nothing unexpected
happens with it and I can just leave it there and don't have to worry about it.

The btrfs filesystem seemed like the opposite of that. A very powerful tool
whose power and flexibility made it less general purpose by virtue of needing
to keep close tabs on how you were using it.
