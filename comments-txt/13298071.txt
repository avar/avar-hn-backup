Still? I think you've got me confused with someone else. I can hardly be said
to "still" be maintaining some position when my one contribution to this thread
as of writing this is a one paragraph comment.

I don't see how any reading of my one comment here could indicate that I'm
attacking the fundamental existence of unions, which to clarify, I have nothing
against.

    > Why are you still attacking a temporary
    > solution to a much larger problem?

My one paragraph comment was simply pointing out, something you failed to
address in the grandparent's comment, that power structures once enacted tend
to stick, and they tend to serve their own ends.

Which is not to say that unions can't be a net positive for workers employed as
part of the union, that obviously depends.

But if you're being made part of a union's purview and they've structured their
rules in such a way that you can't vote, then it should be fairly obvious that
they're structurally not interested in representing you, and will in fact
represent the interests of voting members at your expense.
