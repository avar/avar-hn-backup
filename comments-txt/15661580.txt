Now imagine a future technology where you could undergo some hypnosis /
gaslighting treatment to forget you even hired this person.

I.e. pay a lot of money in advance, it's invested and the actor gets paid from
the interest. You undergo memory treatment, and now your mother who you see
once a week is real as far as you know, but really she's an actor you hired
years back because your actual mother died.
