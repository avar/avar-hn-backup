Public urinals like these are all over Amsterdam: http://goo.gl/LbWxd4 you're
rarely more than a couple of blocks away from one.

They're male-only, and just a metal spiral leading to a cement wall that you
pee on, and a drain below that wall.

They're very simple & easy to maintain, and all you need to clean them is a
pressure washer. Public urination is practically unknown with these around.
