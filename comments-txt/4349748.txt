Something Google could to do drastically improve the security of their
two-factor authentication system is to add the ability to give more granular
permissions with the application-specific passwords.

I have an application that only needs to send E-Mail through my GMail account
(git-send-email), another that only needs to write to one specific GMail label
(Android SMS Backup), and Google Chrome surely doesn't need access to
everything. But you'd get full access to my account if you compromised any of
these.

They already have this for the Connected Sites, Apps, and Services. I sent them
a feature request for this a while ago but it hasn't been answered (and there's
no way to view it online).
