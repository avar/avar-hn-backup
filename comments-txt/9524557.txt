The same as on Wikipedia or any other collaborative "wiki"-like tool. There are
active mappers in each area that look at changes that are being done there, we
also have access to the complete edit history so we can see what changed when,
where and by whom.

People do vandalize the data occasionally, or accidentally screw something up.
That gets dealt with relatively quickly.

Although like Wikipedia the likelyhood of someone spotting bad edits is
inversely proportional to how "busy" the area is, if you're going to add a new
street to the center of Paris that's likely to be spotted much sooner than
adding some fake country rode to the middle of Siberia.

Mostly it just works though because good actors outnumber bad actors by many
orders of magnitude.
