The assumption here is that if this were to catch on as a security mechanism
the establishment you're in would clearly advertise their merchant name, or you
could at least ask for it.

It wouldn't take that many customers to ask before the guy behind the counter
at "Corner Cafe Market" would be able to give you "Culinary Drinkware Inc." as
their merchant name offhand.
