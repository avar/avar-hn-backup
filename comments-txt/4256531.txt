I have lots of cronjobs that use the Moose type system to validate data before
it gets inserted into either a MySQL row or an ElasticSearch document.

It's a really nice method and has caught a lot of errors in the data those jobs
are slurping up before they've impacted production.

It also allows you to do very complex type checking that you wouldn't be able
to do in the native type systems of most languages (e.g. with
MooseX::Types::Structured), like checking not only whether something is a hash,
but it can only have these keys, and each of those keys have to match some
constraint.

Obviously you can write custom code to do all that, but offloading it to the
type system is so much nicer, and makes it trivial to share those checks
between different modules.

It also makes it easy to selectively disable checks, e.g. if you have a large
blob of data you're inserting into permanent storage in a cronjob you might
like to to extensive validation of it, but you might not want to incur that
validation cost on every retrieval in the system that consumes that data.
