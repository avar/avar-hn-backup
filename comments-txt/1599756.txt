> Are approved revisions really a branch or just a tag somewhere in a linear
version history?

A Git branch is just a different head, but no, those things don't have
divergent histories. They're just moving tags. Anyway, semantics aside I meant
that they're doing things now that maps effortlessly to a scm.

> Having n branches of a Wikipedia article would be frowned upon

Not if it was well supported. Saying "hey, I modified the article in my own
private branch, check it out and merge it if you want" would beat a long
argument on a talk page any day.

Branch support doesn't need to entail multiple publicly accessible (as in the
stuff normal readers see) versions of articles.

> Also, Git-style branches only make sense as alternative branches of the
entire repository

What? No, they'd also make sense even if there was one Git repository per page.

We won't know until we try, will we? But there are lots of advantages to using
a well understood and simple data format with multiple implementations over a
custom schema, but of course a custom format has its own advantages.
