Thanks a lot for that reference. I listened to that episode, it's got a really
interesting idea related to a "marketplace for organs" that I hadn't heard
about before.

They describe setting up a consensual "kidney club". The idea being that if
you're in the club and need a kidney, one member of the club is chosen at
random and compelled to give you a kidney, but likewise if you have kidney
failure and would otherwise die you get a kidney from a random member.

This sidesteps the usual concerns about implementing a marketplace for organs.
I.e. even if you're a billionaire the only way to insure yourself against
kidney failure is to enter the pool of potentially mandatory donors, and you
can of course stay outside the "kidney club" and not have to donate to anyone,
but then you also die if you have kidney failure.

Katz points out that the reason this doesn't work is that current law can't
compel you to donate your organs, even if you've previously signed a contract
to that effect, but that this creates a market failure & tragedy of the
commons.

Implementing a system like this seems like a no-brainer and a benefit for
everyone involved, but it's blocked by current contract law & the inability to
force people to undergo medical procedures they consented to in the past.
