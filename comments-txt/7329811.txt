I work at a company in Amsterdam that employs a lot of non-natives (myself
included) including several Russians & Ukrainians. I don't think it would be
appropriate to name-drop the company given the topic, but contact me if you're
interested.

Anyway, given my admittedly somewhat limited knowledge of immigration law I
don't think what you want to be looking at at all is getting asylum somewhere.
That's going to be a process that's a giant pain in the ass anywhere in the
world.

There's also lots of major caveats with getting asylum, generally to do with
you or your ethnic/social group being specifically discriminated against or
otherwise in danger. You're generally not going to get asylum just because you
don't like the general security situation in your country of residence. If that
was the case the first world would pretty much grant blanked asylum to millions
to billions of people living in the failed states of the world.

If you have a specialist skill such as being a developer a much better and
quicker path to emigrating is to get a work visa somewhere, and go from there
to potentially getting a permanent residence permit or even citizenship
