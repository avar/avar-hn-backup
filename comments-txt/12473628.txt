This thing is not exactly something you can just order online at http://

Obviously if China wants to buy one the fact that they want to reverse engineer
its technology is going to be patently obvious.

Even if China could get a hold of an AN-225 reverse engineering one is a huge
task, and at best you only know exactly what this hardware did, not what they
avoided, or good ideas they didn't pursue purely due to resource constraints
etc.

So what happens instead is that a state like China approaches the Ukraine for a
manufacturing agreement like the one described in the article. China hands over
a lot of money which covers not just the planes but also the tech, and job are
created in the Ukraine as a result.
