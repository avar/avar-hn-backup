Another approach you can use in some cases with the JVM, which is often the
simplest, is to set up the JVM so it doesn't GC (give it a lot of memory), then
either just spawn a new JVM to take over, or take the machine about to run a GC
out of your load-balanced pool before running a full GC, then put it back in
again.

Doing the manually triggered & staggered GC trick on a pool of machines you
control can give you very low latency guarantees, since no production request
will ever hit a GC-ing JVM.
