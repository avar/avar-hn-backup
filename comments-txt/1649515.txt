Of course sites are still going to produce content in Flash, but nowadays they
at least have to consider that by doing so they're making it impossible for an
ever increasing market segment to view their content.

I ran Debian on a PPC machine a few years ago so I couldn't use Flash. Back
then only very odd setups like that didn't have it. Nowadays millions of people
are buying new top of the line devices that don't support it, so the tide is
turning as a result.
