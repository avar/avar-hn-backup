I don't see how this is a relevant comparison in this context beyond the
trivial "Debian has had some packages built from source at install time in the
past".

At the time qmail was shipped in Debian's non-free section, and the resulting
binary wasn't being linked to a GPL codebase to get around linking clauses.

So I can't see how this has anything to do with what's happening with ZFS here.
