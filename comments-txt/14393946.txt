I live in Amsterdam too. This meme that we're all under sealevel is common, but
wrong.

While literally true in some areas is extremely misleading in the context of a
discussion about how rising sealevels impact world cities in general. Your
Wikipedia source shows that the elevation goes as low as -2 meters, not that
that's the mean elevation of the city.

Here's an elevation map of Amsterdam:

And here's one of The Netherlands:

Now I happen to live -1 below in Amsterdam, but I'm the exception. Most of
Amsterdam is above sealevel, the average seems to be around 6-10 meters above.

But most importantly, the elevation profile of the entire country is one where
the coast is much higher than sealevel, and then gradually slopes downwards to
bits of the interior that are entirely landlocked, but are say 1 meter below
sealevel. In other words we have pockets of land that are below sealevel, but
they're surrounded by and protected by land that's not.

There's pretty much zero overlap between where Amsterdam has been sited for the
last 800 years and the areas that are anywhere near being under sealevel.
