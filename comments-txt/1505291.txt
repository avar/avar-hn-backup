This is getting ridiculous. Why doesn't Wikileaks just host all their content
in a Git repository and use GPG to sign their releases?

Then it would be impossible to take down the site, and anyone could easily spin
up a mirror.

Instead there's one monolithic distribution site which isn't decoupled from
their submission network. The site is frequently down during a fundraiser, and
due to how they run it other people can't easily directly contribute resources
to run mirrors of the site.

I'm beginning to think that Wikileaks is not as interested in actually getting
leaks out as it is furthering Julian Assange's personal indispensability.
