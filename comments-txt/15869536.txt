Fuel taxes are a very crude tool, road tolls are much better instrument to
actually regulate the behavior you care about.

If you raise fuel taxes because there's too much congestion that's going to
equally affect someone who lives in some rural area where congestion isn't an
issue at all, and someone who's driving down a busy freeway every day
contributing to congestion.

You also raise the price of gasoline, which has other uses that have nothing
whatsoever to do with road transport.

If you want to discourage specific behavior you should tax that specific
behavior, not tax something one or two steps removed from the behavior you care
about.
