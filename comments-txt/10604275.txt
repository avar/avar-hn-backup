As far as I know neither of those failures would have resulted in loss of crew.
One was a partial failure where due to a partial engine failure they didn't
make their secondary orbital insertion, and the other was a loss of vehicle
that would have been covered by either the crew escape system, or the dragon
capsule parachuting to safety.
