The problem is that ARM is a licensable architecture, so there are lots of
minor variations in sub-architectures.

The companies maintaining these have no motivation to consider the problem of
maintaining /all/ of these, they're happy to basically copy/paste some other
code until their CPU work.

Linus is saying that that's not going to work anymore, that they're going to
have to come up with a way to consolidate their codebases.
