There's lots of uses for random but predictable numbers, e.g. adding random
fuzz to a test suite run that you'd like to be able to repeat.

A weak random number generator that usually powers rand() is also usually
faster and takes less CPU to run.

Both of these things were thought to be more important in more innocent times
when C was standardized.

OpenBSD's decision makes sense on balance, it gives some security to otherwise
insecure programs by default, the trade-off is breaking programs written
against the C standard which make assumptions about the documented rand()
behavior.
