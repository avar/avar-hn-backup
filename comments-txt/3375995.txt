Actually most things in science aren't getting more complex, in fact they're
getting less complex.

If you're on the bleeding edge of particle physics then sure, things are
getting more complex. But most discoveries to be made in science are relatively
mundane everyday things, and just a matter of paying attention in a structured
manner.

E.g. most forms of life on the planet haven't been studied in any detail for
the simple reason that nobody's gotten around to it yet, but the methods and
tools to do so are much easier than they were 50 or 25 years ago.

Anyone can contribute to science, and it's now easier than ever before, and
some of those contributions might unearth something we didn't expect.
