I wasn't expecting a follow-up question to be a question about the company I
was working at in particular. I mainly replied to give some (admittedly
amateur) general advice on seeking asylum v.s. pursuing a work visa.

Since he did ask what projects we have at the company that I happen to work at
I thought it was simpler just to mention where I work.

We have a lot of promotion & hiring material online, and it's way easier just
to mention where I work and have the OP check that out than for me to write up
some some long-winded description of what the company does, all the while
trying not to mention what company I'm talking about.

It's not like there's that many companies in Amsterdam that run online hotel
booking websites. So any interested reader could infer what company I was
talking about anyway if I were to describe what sort of projects we work on.
