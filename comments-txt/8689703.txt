That's not the issue at all. If you look at the historical budget of NASA[1] it
has a very low correlation with Republican presidents[2].

The main issue is that they get a lot of misdirected funding that's mainly
allocated as a function of short-term political interests, and that's an
entirely bipartisan issue in the United States.
