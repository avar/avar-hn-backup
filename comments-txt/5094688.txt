Define "up there". Space junk is only an issue because it's in the wrong orbit,
regardless of how cheap their hardware is they can avoid it becoming an issue
by inserting it into an appropriate orbit where it'll burn up or be directed
away from the Earth. As I understand it in the long term they aren't going to
be doing much in LEO anyway where space junk is an issue.
