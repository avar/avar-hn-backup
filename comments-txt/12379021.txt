Bound? The people of Germany, in this example, voted for a government that
approved the TTIP. If they don't like it they can vote again and leave the
agreement.

If it's not obvious from my comments I'm not advocating for agreements like the
TTIP or other agreements that enforce international trade in this comment
chain.

I'm just saying that if people want agreements like that in some shape or form
that's going to necessarily result in some loss of national sovereignty. Any
international trade agreement worth its salt will do that.

As an example. Let's say there's been an agreement between the US and Germany
to enforce no tariffs on their trade. Now Germany is massively subsidizing its
steel industry and there's a Delaware startup trying to smelt steel to compete
with them.

Don't you think there should be a dispute mechanism in place to say "hey guys,
we agreed to no tariffs, that really doesn't make sense if you subsidize steel
and we don't".?
