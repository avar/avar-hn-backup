In Iceland in particular (and I'm guessing a lot of countries have the same
situation) what'll happen is that the Ministry of Education will publish some
official recommendation about what formats should be used, or that free/open
source software should be "strongly considered".

Then what happens in practice is that everyone just ignores that recommendation
and buys proprietary software anyway, feigning compatibility with existing
systems, re-training costs etc.

So in practice a government recommendation about ODF can mean absolutely
nothing unless you really make it mandatory. So this map on Wikipedia is
effectively useless as an indicator for "adoption". It's probably actually a
map of what governments have made feel-good press releases about ODF.
