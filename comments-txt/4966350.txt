    > So much that Wikipedia devotes its own page to US serial killers.

Aside from any of this Wikipedia devotes a lot of pages to US-specific things
because it has a lot of contributors in the US. You shouldn't draw any other
conclusion from it than that. You'll see a lot of US-bias and US-specific
coverage on any topic on the English Wikipedia.
