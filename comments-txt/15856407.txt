The reduced price option for individuals is that you just look at the last
working draft, which is always published for free for all ISO standards and is
almost equivalent to the final product.

The only reason anyone cares about the officially published standard is if
you're a compiler vendor who wants to know for sure that your product is
standards compliant, which is why the cost for the no-draft versions is what it
is.
