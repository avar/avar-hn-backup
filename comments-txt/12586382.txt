I'm not talking about shooting captive elephants in zoos, but having legalized
hunting in massive game reserves big enough for these animals to range in.

E.g. this Radiolab episode interviews a guy who paid to hunt a black rhino, it
goes into how populations of wild animals have been boosted in certain parts of
Africa by massive game reserves that are run for-profit for hunting purposes:
