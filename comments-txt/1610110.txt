I'm citing the design aims of Tcpcrypt, from their website.

Not everything uses HTTP, a bunch of things like Torrent, IRC etc. use
unencrypted protocols by default, and you have to explicitly add support to
each one for encryption. Either by adding SSL support to the programs
themselves, or by setting up a tunnel.

That's not the same as using opportunistic encryption that can happen at the
kernel level. You could also do that with SSL to achieve the same aims, but the
point is that it's opportunistic and happens without further userspace
configuration.
