I've been using Hetzner for about a year after migrating off Slicehost to
Linode and then to Hetzner.

I'd recommend Linode if you need really good service (they once tracked down
and patched a kernel bug for me), but if you don't want amazing support and
just want some really good specs at a good price Hetzner is great, especially
if you're in Europe.
