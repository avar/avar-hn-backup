Organic isn't the answer, it's trying to address some legitimate concerns, but
it's a movement full of scientific woo-woo that's been legislated.

For instance, organic farming thinks GMO's are bad, but is just fine with
irradiating large fields full of plants to accomplish random mutations through
radiation breeding.

This article is one example of this, the author decries traditional corn
fields, and as a counterexample wants us to believe that some hilly
permaculture farm in Austria which just from the looks of it obviously has to
be harvested & maintained by hand would be a viable replacement.

Organic is largely just a western luxury product supported by people with no
concern about producing food at true scale, and how we can satisfy the global
food supply without impoverishing a large part of the population by doing
manual labor on farms.

There's no panacea when it comes to farming, but GMOs seem to be the best shot
we have.
