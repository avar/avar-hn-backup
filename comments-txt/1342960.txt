Why yes, a lot of us are just fine spending "hours" learning something that
we'll probably spend more than a few years using.

Git's user interface isn't perfect, but you're not going to get the "Mac of
DVCSs" either. There's a reason for the complexity, doing stuff like merging
together the work of three people is inherently complex.

You're not going to come up with some solution that allows the user to "just do
it" without also destroying history.
