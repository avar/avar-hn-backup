It doesn't have to map perfectly as long as both end in the same suffix. Test
with:

    git -c url.https://git.freedesktop.org/projects/.insteadOf=git://freedesktop.org/ clone git://freedesktop.org/harfbuzz.git
    Cloning into 'harfbuzz'...
    fatal: unable to access 'https://git.freedesktop.org/projects/harfbuzz.git/': Failed to connect to git.freedesktop.org port 443: Connection refused

Then set it in your config:

    git config --global url.https://git.freedesktop.org/projects/.insteadOf git://freedesktop.org/

And now anything on your system cloning or fetching git://freedesktop.org/
harfbuzz.git will use https://git.freedesktop.org/projects/harfbuzz.git
instead.
