As the parent of a 1 year old, this looks great, can the content filtering be
disabled, since this is a Live CD?

I wonder if there's any evidence whatsoever for content filtering actually
being useful for children's development, as opposed to just reinforcing
societal squeamishness.

The example they have[1] on their page is blocking the DuckDuck go result for
"sex", whose first result is the Wikipedia article.

I really can't imagine why a child who's developed enough to search for that on
their own isn't ready to read about it. To the extent that the parent needs to
be around to explain things to the child I don't see how that needs to be done
for sex in particular, as opposed to say economics.
