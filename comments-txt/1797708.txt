Without going into what are probably the actual reasons for these war the
public justification for them has never been that people are "upset about this
one particular event". The US and its allies aren't directly avenging the
deaths of those 3,000 people.

Rather it's recognized that if the perpetrators had the chance they would
probably have killed 30 thousand, or 3 million. So the public justification for
the "War on Terror" has been to prevent similar future events.

See e.g. this interview with Tony Blair where he makes that exact point:
