Parrot's been claiming that it's slow and incomplete now, but a solution to
that is just around the corner for a few years.

Maybe that's true, but I think that'd be the main concern of any compiler
writer thinking of targeting it. It's not a mature platform with known pros and
cons, unlike the JVM or LLVM.

I hope it all turns out for the best and Parrot delivers on its promises. But I
can see why e.g. the PHP team isn't rushing to target it given the state of its
native languages.
