Another interesting thing about Google Translate is that people sometimes
successfully troll it by amusing the "submit a better translation" feature,
which Google ostensibly uses without much checking.

I'd point out an example, but Google's engineers probably read this site, and
the examples I have are too valuable for my personal amusement to give up :)
