Many have some sort of same-sex unions, what Iceland did recently is eliminate
all occurrences of "man and a woman" and replace them with "two persons" in
their laws.

Most countries that have same sex unions have a different set of laws for them,
usually for religious and political reasons. The Church of Iceland opposed the
recent change, but it lost that battle.

Regarding JÃ³hanna, it's sad that the first openly gay head of state is also so
openly incompetent :)
