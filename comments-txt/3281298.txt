Whenever I read one of these articles I'm struck by how disconnected the vast
financial abstractions we've constructed are from reality.

Essentially they just discuss problems with the shared illusion (debt, bonds
etc.), but not problems with what those abstractions actually mean.

What's going to happen in a few weeks to cause everything to come crashing
down? We'll still have the same people working, the same infrastructure /
factories etc.

I'm not saying the issues aren't real. Just that they're always discussed
through so many layers of jargon to essentially be meaningless to someone who
doesn't work in finance.
