The article is discussing taller populations, not individuals. Within
populations being tall tends to be a proxy metric for general prosperity, so of
course it's a positive.

Aside from that there seem to be intrinsic advantages to being tall. Taller
people have bigger bodyparts, including bigger brains, and there's a
correlation between larger craniums and higher intelligence[1].

This doesn't seem to be a very thoroughly studied subject though, but it really
should be. If there's anything we could be doing to increase the average
intelligence of human species that's going to pay dividends down the road.
