I understand all of that and yet I understand none of it. The article is
talking about explaining things to people in an understandable manner, and
that's a bad example.

I don't care that you did your data analysis with $technology unless I happen
to be the maintenance programmer that's having to take over that project.

Why did you do the data analysis, how did you do it, and what were your
findings, and what does any of that entail would be what most people are
interested in.

Even if I'm interested in the technology you've told me nothing. What are the
main bottlenecks in your stack, how does it scale, does it even need to scale
at all etc?

It's not only important that your audience understands what you're saying, but
that you pick the right and pertinent items to discuss with them.
