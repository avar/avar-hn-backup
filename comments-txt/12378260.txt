I think you're fundamentally misunderstanding representative democracies.
Nothing about them says the can't enter into an agreement to create a
pan-national body to settle trade disputes, as opposed to escalating every
incident to a diplomatic dispute.

If people don't like that they'll make in an election issue, and either it'll
be re-negotiated after the next election or the nation will leave the trade
agreement. That's the democratic process at work.

How is that a better option anyway? So now instead of some court that has to be
seen to be fair to the entire trade block deciding things, you want to have n^2
potential dispute mechanisms in place between the n countries that are part of
the agreement?

Or you could look at this from the flip side of that argument, which is that
it's detrimental to international trade if companies can't make international
investments without being at risk to domastic political whimsy that runs
counter to the spirit of the trade deal that was initially agreed upon.
