The most relevant quote in the article:

This problem would be solved tomorrow if those allocating public money to
science made funding contingent on the research being published in open access
journals.

Scientists can't have their cake and eat it too. Either they fund their own
research and publish in prestigious expensive journals that cost the public
money, or they take public money and make the research available for all.

But it's not easy to migrate to that because scientist aren't just using
journals as a publication platform, but as a reputation platform as a function
of their exclusivity and reputation.
