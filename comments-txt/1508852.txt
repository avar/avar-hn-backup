Obviously we'll never know, and we can speculate all day. But I don't think
it's unreasonable to assume that yes, Germany would have calmed down
eventually.

Empires have a tendency to reach their zenith and slowly recede after that.
When you have occupying powers like Nazi Germany they're likely to fall apart
eventually due to internal strife. The Roman Empire did, so did the Soviet
Union, partly.

Had WW2 not happened we might just have had a Cold War with four actors (USA,
UK, Germany, Soviet Union) instead of 2. The world might not be too different
today, with Germany either toppled from within, or having had their version of
the civil rights movement.

Then again they might have tried to take over the entire world. But I think
it's somewhat naïve to extrapolate states at their most violent beginnings to
how they might have evolved in the future.

If some hypothetical world police would have stopped the USA at its beginnings
we might very well read in our history books today that if it wasn't for that,
the US would have proceeded to eradicate the rest of the world's indigenous
peoples. And that it would still be keeping millions of people as slaves.

In reality the fate of states is more complex than the plans of any one man.
Even if he's the Führer.
