This is very nice. Between this and Booking.com's (disclaimer: I work there)
 €100,000 donation just over a month ago TPF is really getting on track for
having large corporate sponsorship from organizations who recognize how
valuable Perl is for their infrastructure.

I talked to some of the TPF people at Booking.com's donation event and they
expressed desires to have more paid-for developers working on the Perl 5 core,
and they're really gearing up as an organization for making that happen.

One thing of note for those unfamiliar with the Perl community: Notice how both
of these big grants are earmarked for Perl 5 development, not Perl 6
development.

By now Perl 6 is viewed as best an interesting research project by
organizations using Perl 5 in production.

I don't mean that as a comment to detract away from what the Perl 6 developers
are doing, but to point out that it's a very different pattern than what's
happening with the next generation of Python, Ruby, PHP etc. runtimes.
