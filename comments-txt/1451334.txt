What football (I'm European) needs is much larger penalties for feigning
injuries and taking dives.

There's a good reason you see players rolling around on the pitch like bruised
4 year old girls, it's beneficial in the long run to the player feigning
injury. You're more likely to win a beneficial free kick from it than two
yellow cards in a row, so the practice continues.

Some national football associations (e.g. Italy) start training kids to do this
at a young age.

It would probably stop overnight if a player seen taking a dive were to
directly receive a red card, or a three game ban.
