Yes I'm pretty sure you're right. I wrote most of my comment from memory and
just dug up a reference, knowing the FAA doesn't operate GPS, but figured their
FAQ was summarizing the satellite features.

But I've searched around and can't find anything that indicates that this is a
feature of the satellites themselves, rather it's just as you say, the US
military has replaced SA with the general ability to jam local radio traffic,
including GPS. E.g. [1] is another source for that.

So it does look like the US can't block GPS for entire countries anymore, I
take that back.

I must say though, I think any public commentary about GPS capabilities should
be taken with a huge grain of salt. It's a military system, they're very likely
lying or not telling the full truth about what it's really capable of. E.g. I
find the claim that the new generation can't do SA by design dubious, surely
just fuzzing the signal by some offset is a rather trivial change.
