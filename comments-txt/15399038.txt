The article is a badly written opinion piece that meanders through various
topics, but your critique of it is beating a strawman.

It's not making the "you can't win" argument that tech companies should be
critiqued whether or not they build housing.

Rather, it's that they're supposedly constructing "company towns" in the sense
that the housing stock they build won't be for sale, and presumably only rented
to employees. If you get fired you also get evicted.

Furthermore they'll own the nearby retail space as well. Will an Oculus
competitor be for sale in the Facebook-owned chain of stores? Will someone
trying to organize a Facebook union be allowed to use the meeting spaces at the
Facebook town hall?
