Sure, that's a factor in US politics. I'm just saying that has nothing to do
with having a heterogeneous population as the parent was claiming.

The parent was comparing the proportion of physicians in Cuba v.s. the US and
claiming that the US couldn't match Cuba because of its heterogeneous
population.

Now if you look at the WHO report on density of physicians[1] you see
first-wold countries like Japan and Canada ranking below the US on the number
of physicians per-capita.

I think numbers like these have a lot more to do with how the health care
system is structured than the sort of population you have. E.g. maybe nurses in
Japan and Canad have a bigger role in health care than the US.
