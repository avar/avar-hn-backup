Not only that, but MySQL AB considered their network protocol to be GPL as
well, and went after anyone who tried to make a clean-room implementation of
it.

I don't know whether SUN and Oracle still pursue that strategy. Otherwise you
could indeed bundle MySQL with some clean-room libraries to talk to the server.
