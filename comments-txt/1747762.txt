This is much better, but 2048 pixels is still significantly smaller than modern
high-quality digital cameras produce. It would be better if they weren't scaled
down at all.

They also don't mention what happened to previously uploaded photography.
Presumably there's no way to get the high-quality originals upscaled now and
users have to re-upload them.
