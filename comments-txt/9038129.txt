If you generate ids like:

    <fixed width timestamp><random data>

Your ids are guaranteed to be sorted chronologically until you start generating
them at the same time. So as a hack to work around that they generate:

    <fixed width timestamp><fuzzed random data>

Where the fuzz to the random data ensures that it's sorted chronologically.
