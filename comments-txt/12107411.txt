As others have said some organizations simply just want to pay you because it's
easier for them legally.

I and a friend of mine took a high-res photo of an insect and I uploaded it to
my flickr account under a CC-BY-SA license.

I got contacted by some publisher of a textbook from the UK and the
conversation went like this:

    them> We'd like to pay you for your photo
    me> no worries man, you don't need to, it's freely licensed, just
        use it and credit us.
    them> Uh, this really would just be easier if we give you money.
    me> Ok, if you insist.

They ended up giving us a few beer cases worth of money for something they
could have gotten for free, because their corporate processes presumably didn't
jive with getting freely licensed work from some website.
