From the perspective of someone living in mainland Europe the legislation
around bars in the U.S. is quite baffling.

I was over in San Francisco last summer and walked out of a bar pint in hand to
tag along for a cigarette break, we were promptly chastised about it. I
apologized saying that I'd briefly forgotten what continent I was on.

It's also not unusual to see children milling around with their parents in bars
in Europe well into the evening. There's no demand that you have to be of
drinking age to be in the establishment, just that you can't be sold drinks if
that's not the case.

All in all it contributes to a more relaxed atmosphere around drinking and I
suspect to overall moderation and safety around drinking.

If you ban guns in bars then someone who carries a gun around anyway will have
to stash it somewhere before they arrive, or risk breaking the law.

I carry a swiss army knife on my keychain because it's a useful tool, I bring
that to bars I go to. I don't think I'm any more likely to attempt to stab
someone after a few pints than I otherwise would.
