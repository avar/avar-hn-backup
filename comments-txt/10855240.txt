There are some people who are using "free basics" now that wouldn't have any
Internet access without it. Now, you could argue and I'd probably agree with
you that it's bad in the long term, creates a distorted market etc.

But if a foreign company offers a net subsidy to access a part of the Internet
shouldn't that drive down the price of Internet access for everyone? I.e. you
could access "free basics" and also have a complimentary Internet subscription
that could be offered at a lower price since your Facebook traffic would be
subsidized.
