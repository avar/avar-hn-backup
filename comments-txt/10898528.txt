Exactly. I lost my GoPro Hero Black v3 rappelling down a canyon[1] in Bali,
later borrowed a friend's v4 because I was considering replacing it.

The display was fancier but less functional, when I was handling the camera and
pressing buttons it would dark out momentarily unlike v3, it had better specs
but all stuff that doesn't matter anyway for the reasons you mention.

Sad to see that every great product like this seems to inevitably succumb to
death by product management by piling feature on top of feature, instead of
just doubling down on what makes it a great product in the first place.

1. Hit the plastic casing at exactly the wrong spot against a rock wall so it
popped open and the camera flew into the river below
