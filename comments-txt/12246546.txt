I'm not, I didn't mean to give the impression that I was. I've been to
Singapore a few times though, and have eaten in the Chinatown hawker center
discussed in the article several times so I thought I'd correct beachstartup's
misconception of it.

It's certainly nothing like a "food court inside of a shopping mall" and the
comment that it's "frequented by affluent professionals" is laughable. People
from all walks of life eat in Singaporean hawker centers.

By "street food" in the western sense I assumed beachstartup was talking about
mobile hot dog / kebab stands you can find in the US, or similar (but more
often stationary) stands you can find on the street in many European cities.

I don't remember any of that in Singapore, although I wouldn't be surprised if
it exists. Instead the demand for street food is satisfied by hawker centers.
