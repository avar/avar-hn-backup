How many people do you know who smoke? A lot of middle and lower-class people
smoke.

Some searching reveals that the smoking rate is north of 25% in both France and
Belgium, and a pack of cigarettes in France is 7 EUR, let's round that down to
5.

So for a 110 EUR (~$130) meal we're talking about the equivalent of 26 days of
1 pack a day smoking, or just under 2 weeks of 2 pack a day.

Which I believe eloquently makes the point that you're out of touch with just
how much $130 of disposable income over a year is.

We're talking about saving 30 cents/day, hardly out of reach of even the
poorest of people who'd like to treat themselves to something like an expensive
restaurant on a yearly basis.
