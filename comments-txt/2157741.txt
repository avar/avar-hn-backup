What gives you that idea? I run several cronjobs that deal with their service,
and it's down a lot compared to other similar services. My jobs deal with that
gracefully, but if I wanted to I could easily set up a more reliable service
than GitHub if my only goal was to host *.git repositories, not have any of the
other nice things they provide.
