The proponents of both have, in the words of a paper on the subject[1] agreed
that "the two achieve the same distributive outcome through an appropriate
tax-benefit system, [but] are fundamentally different from economic and ethical
points of view".

Consider trying to introduce a universal health care system. You might say why
do we need a system that subsidizes Jeff Bezos's health care? He can damn well
pay for it himself, he might even agree since it's going to cost him less in
terms of his tax contributions.

That's the equivalent of trying to sell NIT. Right out of the gate you have to
not say "this is for everyone" but "it's just for the poor, but don't worry
because...". That's what I mean by the marketing being different.

Of course with UBI the benefit is literally fungible, it's money. So it's
really not like universal health care, but in the minds of a lot of people it
is. They find it easier to accept the state providing a service if it's
provided to them as well, even though it's a net cost center for them.

Humans.
