A lot of mountaineering gear costs a lot, but lasts for a really long time.
It's like buying a car in some ways. So your go-to solution should be to buy
used.

There's no shortage of people who bought an $800 backpack along with $2000 of
other gear, who thought they'd be using them regularly, who later find out that
they made a significant investment in a hobby they don't care much about.

Unless you're swimming in money buying gear from those people should be your
first choice.

Knowing what to buy is also a huge factor. E.g. the market for backpacks is a
bit like the market for racing bikes. You can easily end up spending 3-4x what
you actually need because you're convinced that you need the latest & greatest.
A bit like the weekend warriors who buy $4000 carbon fiber racing bikes to
shave of a couple of kilos, which, unless you're competing, is a complete waste
of money.
