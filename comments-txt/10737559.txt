That's something you can easily attain in Git as well, your central repository
just denies non-fast-forwards, which gives you exactly what fossil is giving
you.

What fossil is denying you is the ability to rewrite all history for whatever
reason, whether that's because you want to squash multiple commits or have
decided (after audits etc.) that you really want to rewrite your central
history and start anew.

Nobody needs audibility on unfinished work that hasn't been pushed to the
central repositories (and would thus be protected by non-fast-forward).

To the extent that you would fossil doesn't make the situation better, if I
can't fix up my commits after the fact before I push them I'm just not going to
make those intermediate commits in the first place, which gives the system no
more information to work with, and results in a less convenient workflow for
me.

This whole "we preserve history forever" statement is a red herring. They've
just picked a data model which is hard-immutable, but it doesn't mean that
they're categorically preserving more information, or that tools that have
configurable-immutable datamodels (like Git) preserve less history in practice.
