I really didn't mean to speculate on whether Facebook would be replaced by
something else. Maybe they'll become big enough that nothing will ever replace
them.

But if something does replace them having an API to export the existing data
will be critical to the adoption of the new system.

Even if all your friends use Facebook now, having an export API is the
difference between them clicking on one link (and "approve") to move your data
to the new system, and having to start all over again.

Lowering the barrier of entry will do a lot to increase competition in this
area. Hopefully Facebook will institute meaningful data export policies like
Google has done.
