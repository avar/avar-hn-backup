The concept sounds cool, but what sort of fixes could the Voyager probes
possibly need? They were launched in 1977, that's almost 40 years ago. As far
as I know they're waking up every once in a while and sending telemetry back.

It would be cool to have access to the source code and an emulator, but I
really don't find it plausible that members of the general public could submit
patches to something that's been running smoothly for 40 years, and where the
risks of changes far outweigh the benefits of keeping the existing software
running as-is.
