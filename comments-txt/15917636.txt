I'm not blaming scientists, which should be obvious given my proposed solution
of solving this at the funding level.

Of course some scientists derive value from publishing in prestigious journals,
but if that's the case they can pay for those fees themselves out of their own
pocket, not out of their research grant.

If those journals demand exclusivity, which they often do, the scientists can
of course continue to publish in them if they so choose, but then they can also
fund their own research.
