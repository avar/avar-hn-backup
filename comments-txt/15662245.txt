I'm not sure, but in several European countries the police is able to ask you
for your ID when you're going about your business, there's no limitation that
it must only be in relation to an offence.

Thus any interaction with them could result in you needing to put a stop to
anything else you're doing as you're escorted back to your house to fetch your
ID, unless you're carrying it in the first place.

But the example I provided wasn't such an example, since there was a fine
involved. However just having compelled ID changes even that situation. If
Germany didn't have that I'd probably been able to just pay the fine on the
spot without need to establish my identity.

I don't believe there's anything equivalent to that in the US. Furthermore
since there's no national ID system they don't even know if you have a driver's
license, social security number or passport, so their options for compelling
you to produce ID are limited.
