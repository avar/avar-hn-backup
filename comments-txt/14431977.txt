I was uploading images to Google Maps before that anyway, and if I recall
signed up for it, it's just a point meter.

Google then sends you a summary of how your contributions were doing. Recently
they send me some E-Mail to the effect of "Awesome! Your image on <business
name> has been viewed 100 thousand times!" or something like that.

It entirely turned me off the whole thing and I haven't contributed since. I
thought "why am I contributing to this ad-powered product that they're
monetizing for millions, for free?".

It's kind of hilarious really. If you look at their landing page the benefits
you can gain include things like "...and you can also moderate our forums, for
us, for free!": https://www.google.com/local/guides/benefits/

Yay!
