I wasn't making any argument for why English should be the lingua franca. In
any case all such arguments are academic, it's not like there's going to be
some meeting where the lingua franca gets decided.

Let's say that there was such a meeting and "we" all decided that we're going
to speak Klingon or whatever as a lingua franca. How do you think that would
work? People wouldn't care what the decreed language is, maybe you'd have UN
meetings in it, pass laws to teach it in school in lots of nations or
something.

It would probably become even more of an elitist skill than just using a
language that already has lots of native and non-native speakers already and
lots of culture to go along with it, just like Latin was back when we
effectively had this sort of arrangement, sans the constructed language.

Finally, if you really haven't heard a better reason for why English became the
current dominant language than "it's already spoken by X people, but how come
not Chinese and Spanish" you really owe it to yourself to read some of the
things that come up when you Google the likes of "history of lingua franca"
etc.
