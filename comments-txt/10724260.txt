I'd also really like an answer to this. I've read a few articles about the
subject that allude to there being such a thing as "clan liability" in Japan
but they've never actually gone into any detail on the subject.

I know that in feudal Japan personhood effectively didn't exist in the form
that it does today. You were part of a clan, if you killed someone and died in
the process the clan of that someone could extract revenge on your clan. They
were the actor, not you.

I understand that much of this survives today in the form of shaming, you don't
just bring shame to yourself, but to your family (clan).

But is there actually any legal system in Japan that treats a family or clan as
a collective? Can the liabilities of adults that kill themselves be transferred
to their family?
