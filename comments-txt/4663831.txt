    Also, almost any Mars mission would involve a lot of heavy lifting
    into low earth orbit to construct a vehicle that would transport
    people there and back.

I keep seeing this assertion but I'm genuinely curious to know why this is the
case.

If you're going to assemble the vehicle in LEO anyway before you send it off to
Mars why is it so much better to do so by lifting up X pieces for assembly with
X huge rockets instead of lifting up X * N pieces on X * N smaller rockets?

Sure you get into engineering problems eventually if your rockets are too
small, since any single component can't be larger than those rockets can carry.
But if nobody even has a design for such an in-orbit-assembled vehicle, then
just starting out by making a really big rocket seems to be a case of putting
the cart before the horse.
