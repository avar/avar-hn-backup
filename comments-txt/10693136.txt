I'm not saying you're wrong, but every announcement from NASA about the ISS
seems to have the tone of "It may be in LEO, but it's an invaluable research
platform teaching us lessons that are directly transferable to colonizing the
Moon/Mars". Is that an unfair summary of what's happening on the ISS?
