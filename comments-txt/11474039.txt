A newspapers finances aren't going to be managed by its editorial team, and
bringing themselves up is a distraction from what the editorial team is trying
to achieve.

Furthermore there's no general hypocrisy involved in advocating for stricter
government policy A while following the loose current law to do B because 1)
You gain nothing from changing these things on the individual rather than
policy level and 2) if you do A instead of B you're at a competitive
disadvantage.
