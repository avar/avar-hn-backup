That's an excellent book. I have a paper copy of it. While the article is right
about cellphone chargers things like this lack some context:

    Glass requires so much energy to make - or recycle - that it is
    always more eco-friendly to use aluminium cans

Firstly, that depends on how you recycle things. Perhaps in the UK they melt
down their glass and make it anew, but in some other countries such as Denmark
they'll actually use the same bottle again after cleaning it out.

If you buy a soft drink in a class bottle in Denmark you'll get a container
that looks like it's seen war.

Secondly, it's presuming that pounds sterling is the best way to measure
sustainability, and that just because something costs more now it's less
sustainable in the long run.

Which is just patently silly. We basically have infinite energy on this planet
as long as the sun keeps shining, but we don't have infinite easily accessible
aluminum.

In the future access to basic material resources is going to be a lot more
important than whether someone expended a few extra joules back in 2010.
