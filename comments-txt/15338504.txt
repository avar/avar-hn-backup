As the source of the article indicates[1] they realized they didn't know how to
make FOGBANK in the year 2000, and what they had was manufactured from 1975
until 1989. There's only an 11 year difference between 1989 and 2000, and a 25
year difference between 2000 and 1975.

It's not at all beyond the realm of possibility that the people who developed
the process or were intricately familiar with it were still around.
