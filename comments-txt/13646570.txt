Leaving aside that these numbers seem like some April Fools' gag...

You're obviously just making stuff up and not familiar with how this is done in
Iceland.

Sheep aren't being constantly herded around. During the winter they're inside a
barn because everything is covered in snow, during the entirety of the summer
they free range getting fatter, raising lambs etc. In the autumn there's a big
coordinated herding event (g√∂ngur) where farmers and volunteers in an entire
area coordinate to herd all the free-range sheep into pens for the winter.

So literally nobody in the country works as a full-time sheepherder. Since it's
all over in a matter of days.
