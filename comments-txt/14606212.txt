There's plenty of people, myself included, who don't have a car but would
otherwise probably get one if effortless car services on-demand like Uber
didn't exist. You need to take that into account.

According to some estimates I've seen just constructing a car is equivalent to
3-4 years of carbon footprint of driving it[1][2].

You might say "buy used!". I would, but over the entire economy it would add up
to the same amount, the net demand for new cars would increase.
