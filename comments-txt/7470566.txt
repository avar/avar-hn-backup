What do you mean there aren't any laws? You hand people money in exchange for
their non-legally binding vague promises. This model of exchange has been
around for hundreds if not thousands of years. Legally speaking Kickstarter is
nothing new.

If I meet someone on the street that promises me to try out some new idea and I
give them money the courts aren't going to give me any more credence than
someone who handed a $50 bill to a bum. How is this in any way a new and novel
legal situation?

The only thing that's new is that now due to the Internet more people have the
ability to easily give out their money to potentially stupid initiatives.
