The author mentions how Chrome & Firefox gained a 10% speedup with
Profile-Guided Optimization with GCC et al.

I.e. you compile your program with profiling, then run e.g. a test suite, and
compile your release binary with input from that profiling so the compiler
knows what to optimize.

Has any C compiler closed the loop on that by shipping the full compiler with
the program to do runtime optimization? With on-the-fly symbol replacement
you'd effectively have a C JIT compiler.
