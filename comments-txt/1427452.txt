Urgh no. Few things frustrate me more than reading interesting literature by
people like Dawkins and Chomsky, then going online and finding that 90% of the
interviews with them are conducted by ignorant mass-media shrills. Who
obviously haven't read any of their works, and echo the same stupid questions
that have been asked in every other interview with them.

I'd rather watch two experts in a field conversing. That's thought provocative,
and it gives me good pointers on subjects that I should follow up on.
