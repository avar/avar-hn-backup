There's something truly childish about Chinese diplomacy. They regularly
release statements to the effect that the Chinese people have been insulted by
some obscure diplomatic statement, and now they're implementing sanctions in
the form of banning pop music of all things.

Anyone have any recommendations for books or articles that shed some light on
this seemingly bizarre behavior?
