I've just read that it uses a lot of Linux-specific things, but are there
features that inherently can't be ported to BSD? And are those features
absolutely critical to running it at all?

What I've read sounds more like "we're focusing on Linux, and won't be porting
it" rather than "this software is inherently Linux-only, and can't be ported".

I daresay coming up with a shimmy layer to port it to BSD is probably less
effort than completely rewriting it.
