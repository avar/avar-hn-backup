It's not just another devastated landscape of Europe, it's the single most
naturally devastated landscape on the entire continent.

The National Museum of Iceland in Reykjav√≠k has a permanent exhibition on the
subject that I highly recommend. Since colonization a little over a millennium
ago most of the topsoil has been washed out to sea, wast swaths of the country
that used to be fields or forests are now just bare rock.

Which isn't to say that a devastated landscape can't be pretty.
