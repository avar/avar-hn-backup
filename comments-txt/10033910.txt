The article brushes aside the major issue with how the French are trying to
enforce this, which is that the French government is asserting that its law
should apply to all global properties of an international corporation simply
because it has a subsidiary operating in France.

A quote from Google on the matter:

    "we respectfully disagree with the idea that a national data
    protection authority can assert global authority to control the
    content that people can access around the world."

The author brushes this aside with the assertion that:

    "search engine results aren’t ‘free speech’ to begin with in my
    opinion, they’re re-hashings of someone else’s speech."

And doesn't address the inherent problem with a global company being subject to
the combination of the censorship regulation of all the countries in which it
operates.

What is Saudi Arabia decides to start punishing Google because its image search
shows "revealing" images of women, is that just fine because search engine
results aren't free speech anyway, and any nation on earth should be able to
make laws about search results that apply globally?
