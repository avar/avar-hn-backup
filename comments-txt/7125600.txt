To play devil's advocate, do you think in an alternative universe where Apple
products have built-in easy to use native support for jailbreaking with the
push of a button that some large malware outbreak that only affects those
devices jailbroken devices won't be blamed on them anyway?

Apple has other motivations to maintain their walled garden, but their goals of
controlling the whole experience also extend to things like that. They want
there to be no question that any Apple device is "safe", regardless of
legitimate user configuration.

And as long as users at large aren't demanding general purpose computers who
can really blame them?
