I went to Japan for 2 weeks and didn't go. I went for the food, the onsen, the
city life, nature etc. I wasn't interested enough in their role in WWII to make
the trip all the way down to the southern tip.

I think if I had 4 more weeks in Japan I probably still wouldn't go. I'm much
more interested in say exploring Hokkaido & The Japanese Alps than going to war
museums.
