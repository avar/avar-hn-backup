Sure, it's just that the whole thing has a big "Google's all about stealing
your data" vibe in its advertisements.

When in fact Google would be happy to take his patches, and most of those
data-sharing features are improving the user experience (like type-ahead
suggestions etc.).

That just rubs me the wrong way.
