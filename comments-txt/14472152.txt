I had a chat with a westerner who was a middle-management boss for an
international company in Tokyo overseeing Japanese workers.

After he caught on to the fact that the reason his entire team was still there
was because he was, he had a talk with them explaining that just because he had
to finish something it was fine if they left early.

He ultimately found that no amount of talking about it would work. He said that
if he needed to stay late to finish something he'd pack up and go to a local
caf√© for half an hour, then come back after that to work late on whatever he
needed to finish.
