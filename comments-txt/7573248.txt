No that's not what this policy does.

For the sake of argument (and simplicity) let's say that schooling and other
childhood / early adult expenses for the average citizen cost the state
$100,000, and let's say that in return the state is likely to gain $200,000 in
tax money back from citizens over their lifetime once they become productive
members of society.

It's pretty obvious that if you give adult immigrants who can immediately
become contributing members of the economy a 1/3 tax discount that the state
loses nothing, and only stands to gain from the deal, since they never had to
pay those $100,000 to send them to school as children, that cost was offloaded
to some other nation-state.

The tax contribution of those immigrants to social programs like welfare is
also going to be just the same as the contributions of native citizens, despite
the lower tax rate, because the state isn't also using that tax money to pay
for those $100,000 it never spent.

If anything the flaw in the Dutch policy is that the tax discount isn't large
enough, should last for more than 10 years (i.e. indefinitely, and should be
larger if you promise to get out of the country before retirement), and that
they should offer it to more immigrants, not just the highly skilled.
