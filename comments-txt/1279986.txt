"Ability" doesn't imply "first-class support" or "good idea". In languages that
aren't Lisp this usually ends up being done by passing a raw string to eval()
which is extremely error prone. It's not something you do lightly.

Constructing macros in Lisp however /is/ something you do lightly. A typical
lisp program might have a 20/80 division of macros/functions. You aren't going
to see a sane program in other languages that do the same thing.
