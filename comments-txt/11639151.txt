Well Perl is mainstream enough to be installed on every *nix box, here's
examples of assembly and C functions interoperating with Perl in the same
source file: https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Inline-ASM/ASM.pod#SYN... &

Of course if you do this in Perl every one of your calls will need to go
through a foreign function interface where Perl's structures are translated
back & forth between its idea of datastructures and the OS's idea, avoiding
that is what people really mean when they talk about the "C ABI".
