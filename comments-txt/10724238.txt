This question paraphrased in the context of the article is basically asking
whether or not you believe in ghosts.

Not only would you have to believe in ghosts, but some of these apartments are
in cities that were firebombed by the US in living memory, you'd have to
believe in ghosts that couldn't move around and were local to specific
apartments to care about this more than "were there firebombings in this area?"
or "was this house constructed before WWII?".
