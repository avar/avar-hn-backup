What do you even mean by "devaluing"? Of course a more error prone, dangerous
and expensive driver has less value.

Is pointing this out somehow wrong? I think not pointing it out devalues human
life.

The road of getting rid of fallible humans from boring automatable jobs leads
to Utopia, and I reject your notion that this is somehow inherently different
from e.g automation in agriculture or computing
