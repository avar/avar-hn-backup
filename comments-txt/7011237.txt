In The Netherlands you can go with a bank like ABN that issues you a dongle
called the e.dentifier. It looks like this: http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/

To make an online transaction with it you insert your debit card into it, enter
a random sequence of digits displayed on the bank website as well as your PIN
in the dongle to get a sequence of digits that you enter into the dongle again.

I found it annoying to have to carry this device everywhere in case I needed to
make a bank transaction, so I went with the only bank in The Netherlands that
does TAN codes, ING.

Every 6-8 months or so I'll get a sheet of 100 TAN codes in the snail mail,
I'll OCR the full sheet with offline-enabled Android app whose name I forget,
convert it to a text file, edit it a bit, and encrypt the text file with GPG.

Then when I need to make transfers I can ssh to a box or use my laptop to "gpg
-d tan.txt.gpg | grep ^123" where 123 is the TAN code number that the online
form requests.

They recently amended this system so that there's a second set of TAN codes
(that comes in another snail mail) that they'll supposedly ask for if you make
a transaction from a suspicious IP address, I've yet to use one of those.

It sucks a bit but I find it far better than having to carry some device on my
person at all times.
