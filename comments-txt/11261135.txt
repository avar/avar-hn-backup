You could have an intelligence that's just not smart in the human sense.
Consider running into an alien intelligence evolved from our equivalent of
octopuses, you ask it a questions but it only communicates via color changes on
its body.

Similarly you can conceive of an AI that's smart, self-aware and intelligent
just hasn't been developed to talk to humans.

The Turing test is a fine test to figure out if your AI is conversational with
humans, but the OP I was replying to was suggesting it as a general AI
intelligence test, it's not meant for that, and will give you both false
positives & negatives.
