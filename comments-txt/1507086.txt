Yes, but that's assuming that they publish the text as Twain wrote it. If they
editorialize it enough they'll have produced an original work on top of Twain's
work.

That'll carry their copyright, and since they keep the original under wraps
there won't be a public domain version of it until the copyright of the edition
now being published expires, or someone leaks the original.
