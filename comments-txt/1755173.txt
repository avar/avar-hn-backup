That hasn't been my experience at all. I mostly contribute relatively small
patches to programs that I use myself and see an itch that I need to scratch.

Sometimes it's really hard to get started, but usually the problem you want to
solve is in some fairly isolated subsystem and writing a sane patch only takes
an hour or two at most.

Of course you sometimes step on someone's toes, but more often than not my
patches just get accepted.
