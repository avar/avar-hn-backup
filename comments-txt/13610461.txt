> In case of GPL, you merely sell support licenses.

This really isn't an option for a lot of things, and gives you some really
perverse incentives to make things complex enough that they need support. Who's
going to buy support licenses for /bin/ls, or most of coreutils, or most of
libc?

You'll get people buying support licenses for MySQL and other difficult to
configure & operate codebases, but not for the vast majority of code they use
on their systems.

I work for a big company that runs a shit-ton of open source, we sponsor the
two/three biggest projects we use, but by volume it's 0.1% of the total number
of open source projects we use, at best.

This is a general problem for open source, everyone's using a huge long tail of
infrastructure code that needs to be maintained, but any one company has no
strong reason to support it.
