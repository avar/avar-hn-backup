I assumed game developers did this for pretty much everything that requires
randomness if for no other reason than ease of debugging.

I've written similar non-game code where you generate a random seed and every
other random value is derived from that. Makes it much easier to reproduce
"random" issues because you just need the build + the seed, not luck.
