I reinstalled my laptop with btrfs on / because "why not" about a year ago.

I ran into issues with maintaining a huge ~1M file Maildir, it seemed to do
very badly with huge directories. Some kernel thread would be at 99% CPU while
I was trying to populate a Maildir, and the entire system ground to a halt.

More importantly I would run into issues like running out of space on / with
20G left, but it was the "wrong kind of space". I.e. I had run out of metadata
space but had plenty of file space left and had to run a rebalancing operation
on the filesystem.

I didn't need any of the COW etc. advanced features that btrfs provides, and
didn't test them, but as just a normal user needing a general purpose
filesystem it was a bit too much hassle, especially with needing to administer
the filesystem in a manner similar to how I might administer a RDBMS.

I ended up just going back to ext4.
