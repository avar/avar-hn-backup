The US is peculiar with its nuclear policy in trying to guarantee immediate
response, by contrast say the UK only has nuclear submarines at sea, and it's
expected that there'll be nothing like an immediate response, rather the
captains of those submarines will find out who nuked the UK and respond.

So the answer for deterrence purposes is you don't need to nuke anyone right
away, immediate response is only one layer of the onion when it comes to
nuclear deterrence.
