A fair comparison is not what SpaceX is doing today, but what SpaceX could be
doing with today's technology with multi-percentage points of US GDP as their
funding.

In that context it's not at all impressive that they're just getting past
beating 60s technology, and not even in all cases. Yes they've got reusability,
but there's still nothing as big as the Saturn V.

Edit: To clarify, I think SpaceX is very impressive, but I think we as a
species are doing proportionally less impressive things than in the 20th
century given the level of technology we have. It's not their fault we aren't
spending multi-percentage points of GDP on similarly impressive projects.
