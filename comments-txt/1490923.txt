If that policy's really derived from WWII I daresy they've completely missed
the point. The Data Protection Directive wouldn't help if you Europe were to
fall under Nazi control again.

It's just a law that says the government can't process the data in certain
ways, they still have the data though, and could start mining it by changing
the law, or ignoring it.

If they actually cared they wouldn't be gathering this data in the first place.
The U.S. (officially) keeps a lot less data on its citizens than the average
European country, but that's been changing in the recent decades since the FBI,
NSA and others were founded.
