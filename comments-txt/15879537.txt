In the context of this discussion, which is gold holders hypothetically pumping
& dumping the market it's pretty much only the big reserve holders that matter.

How do you think someone who's gold holdings are 1 kg in a warehouse embedded
in motherboards is going to extract that to dump it on the market? Most gold by
weight is effectively illiquid, while every Bitcoin is equally liquid.

As the source the article uses[1] discusses the breakdown of those 187,200 tons
is:

* Jewellery: 89,200 tonnes, 47.6%

* Private investment: 40,000 tonnes, 21.4%

* Official sector: 31,500 tonnes, 16.8%

* Other: 26,500 tonnes, 14.2%

* Below ground stocks: 57,000 tonnes

So around 50% of the number you're quoting is gold still in the ground. To
repeat your snarky remark: Did you read the article?

I guess counting the official sector and private investment the top 10 official
holders "only" have around 30% of the liquid market, which is way more
distorted than Bitcoin, and very comparable in this context of a few owners of
large liquid assets being able to distort the market.
