Aren't scientific journals more of a hindrance to scientific progress these
days anyway? They're not essential to the peer review process, and the services
that they do provide could be decoupled from publication.

It would be very nice to see a distributed publication system taken up by the
scientific community, based on circles of trust where anyone could partake in
the peer review process.
