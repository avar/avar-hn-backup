Something like "you should explain a joke, it's like dissecting a frog. It's
messy and the frog doesn't survive the process" went a quote whose original
source or exact wording I can't find now.

For what it's worth I meant it in the sense that euccastro pointed out. Not
that this particular change made things worse, but that entering into a deal
which one of the parties can arbitrarily change doesn't make for the stablest
of work environments.
