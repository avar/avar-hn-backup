As anyone who'd read the full paragraph you're quoting knows, that's what they
mean by "tolerating" cats. I.e. a non-friendly symbiotic relationship where
they eat your mice and you don't kill them.

The question they're posing is why were they eventually fully domesticated,
which is not the same thing, nor was necessarily required to get the practical
benefits of domestic cats.
