As another layman I find the Wikipedia article on the subject to be really
good: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere#Structure

There's nothing inherently different about a planet's magnetic field pushing
the stellar/solar wind out of its way and e.g. a boat on water pushing water
out of the way. Terms like magneto(sheath|pause|tail) are just labels for
different parts of the "wake".
