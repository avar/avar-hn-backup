To add to that, in large parts of Europe it's impossible to find showings that
aren't dubbed, or don't have subtitles.

Dubbing ruins the movie entirely, and I find that I can't watch subtitled
movies at all, I get obsessed with both listening to the dialog and comparing
it with the translation.

Around here it costs me at least $300 to see a movie in its original unaltered
format when it opens in theaters, i.e. a round-trip flight to the UK + hotel,
so I just don't go.
