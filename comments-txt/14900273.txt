The non-hacky way to do this sort of thing in both C and C++ is to just use
less clever two-phase compilation as part of your build process.

I.e. you'd have your template compiler extract the HTML from your source (or
more easily, dedicated template files), parse, validate and compile them. The
end result of that would then be embedded in your binary somehow.

The gettext set of tools are a good example how how this works in another
related domain. You extract strings from your program, they and the contents of
corresponding .po files are validated, then compiled to efficient .mo binary
files for runtime use.
