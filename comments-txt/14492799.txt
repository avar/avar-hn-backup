You're commenting in a thread about the UK. Bringing up the specifics of US gun

Yes of course any country trying to cell hydrogen bombs or chemical weapons to
its citizens couldn't do so without international sanctions. The example is
clearly ridiculous, but it's brought up in the context of illustrating that
your argument is equally outlandish.
