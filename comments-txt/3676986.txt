Correct me if I'm wrong but the nature of the vulnerability was that someone
who's not you had to submit a page with certain POST variables they could have
determined after the fact to be malicious while logged in.

So the fact that they're sending out this E-Mail tells us that they either
don't keep logs on requests + POST contents, or that they haven't had the time
or inclination to analyze this data if they have it.
