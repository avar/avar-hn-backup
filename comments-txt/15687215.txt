Everything is like this, just earlier today there was a "Air Travelers
Resisting the ‘Incredible Shrinking Airline Seat’" thread[1] here where if the
comments are to be believed a huge number of people simply don't travel anymore
because the seats are so horrible. Surely nobody would want to fly anymore!

Meanwhile the airline industry has been growing consistently for decades.

Similarly, surely nobody would ever pay $80 for some in-game feature in an EA
game. If you aren't selling EA stock now in anticipation of their inevitable
demise you're a fool!

Stated preferences are very different from revealed preferences.
