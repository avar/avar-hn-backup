So the US can't access the EU through:

   US -> Canada -> EU

But somehow the EU can access the US through:

   EU -> Canada -> US

What part af that path doesn't involve a bidirectional free trade agreement
that would make it just as easy for the US to access the EU via Canada as the
other way around?
