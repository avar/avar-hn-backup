An ex co-worker of mine had that happen to him. Him and his wife traveled to
Austria in the 80s and were having trouble checking into a room in some rural
town because it didn't seem as though they were married.

He was able to find an encyclopedia on a bookshelf in the lobby that said
something to the effect of "In Iceland women do not take their husband's name
when they marry". That resolved that situation.
