After reading Russ's original article in 2007 I did some work on bringing the
nascent regex API in perl's core up to par so one could lexically replace
perl's regex engine with the plan9 engine, PCRE and others.

One interesting product of this work was the ability to compare other regex
engines to Perl's in perl's own test suite. See this journal entry for some
info about that: http://use.perl.org/~avar/journal/33585

Maybe I'll resurrect some of that work once Perl 5.12 comes out and try
dropping in RE2 and see how it compares to PCRE and Perl on the various edge
cases involved.

This would be somewhat easier if RE2 supported Perl's syntax for named
captures.
