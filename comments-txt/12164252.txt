You object to consistently having plentiful nutrition from infancy on the scale
of nations over large time spans being strongly linked to prosperity? That's
essentially what the tall = positive statement is about.

Few things are as well established as strong correlations for prosperity. You
might as well say "I reject reality and substitute my own".
