To pick up the phone is a manner of speaking. I'm wondering why these former
employees seemingly weren't asked to come in as consultants, which reading
between the lines of the article wasn't the case, not this was a trivial matter
that could be entirely resolved with one phonecall.

My reading of the reference to notes is that they were following some written
material left behind by the original team, not that these were notes acquired
from ex-members of the team in 2000.
