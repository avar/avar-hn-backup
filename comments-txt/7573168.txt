The Netherlands even gives you a tax discount for 10 years if you're a highly
skilled migrant, the criteria for being able to apply for it basically comes
down to "is this person likely to need welfare? No? They get lower taxes then":

It makes sense for states to enact programs like these for the reasons you
pointed out. If you can get skilled migrants you get net contributors from day
one.
