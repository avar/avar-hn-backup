It's not just Perl, every language I've seen or heard of except PHP has a clear
distinction between its unordered key-value datatype, and an array datatype.
That includes Python, Lisp, Lua, and others.

PHP has a Frankensteinian mix between the two. You /can/ implement it in any
other language by just keeping an array along with your hash that indicates the
order in which elements were inserted: http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?
Tie::StoredOrderHash

But you almost never want to do this. I've only used it once in all the PHP
code I've written. And having to deal with the ambiguity of PHP's key-value
array datatype wasn't worth it elsewhere wasn't worth that.
