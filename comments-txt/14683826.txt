Western Germany is a very strategic place. If the allies were to leave, who
would take it over? Most likely the Soviets would move in. There's no really
good answer there.

Your statement is similarly silly. The issue in question is whether the
islanders can return & have the right to self-determination.

There's no reason the US & UK couldn't work out some deal with them to continue
having a military presence on the islands, the US has bases in plenty of
sovereign countries, e.g. Germany.
