What would you call it then? Market failures can also be created by ineffective
regulation, as is the case in my example.

Considering the substance of the transaction isn't a viable strategy, it might
be possible at larger scales as in your Ford example, but individuals can and
will find clever ways around tariffs that are impossible for the authorities to
keep up with.

As an example, I lived in a European country where import tolls on bicycles
were much higher than the import fees on spare parts, so if the price of
shipping was low enough you could simply ask the seller to send over a bike in
multiple packages marked as spare parts to evade the import fees.

How are you going to detect cases like that with perfect accuracy? You'd need
some massive tracking system to figure out who bought what, and even then it
could be trivially evaded by me and a friend buying 1/2 of two bikes each as
spare parts and combining them after they've been imported.
