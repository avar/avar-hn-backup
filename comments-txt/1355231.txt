This is always relevant: http://keithp.com/blogs/Repository_Formats_Matter/

"I would like to argue that none of the user-interface and high-level
functional details are nearly as important as the fundamental repository
structure. When evaluating source code management systems, I primarily
researched the repository structures and essentially ignored the user interface
details. We can fix the user interface over time and even add features. We
cannot, however, fix a broken repository structure without all of the pain
inherent in changing systems."

Keith makes a good point. While Git's interface is lacking in some areas, those
things can be fixed in the higher level porcelain. Picking a system with a
nicer interface whose plumbing is uglier will lead to problems further down the
road.
