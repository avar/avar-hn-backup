That was 12 years ago, maybe it changed a lot. I just remember a city that fit
the typical sprawling metropolis model with everything far apart and cars
everywhere that the US is known for. None of it looked very bike friendly
compared to similar cities in Europe.

Edit: The parent pointed out that Minneapolis was one of the top cycling cities
in the US with around 4-5% of trips made by bike (compared to Europe's 2%
average, 10% for Austria & Germany, and >20% for the Netherlands and Denmark).
Then deleted the comment for some reason.
