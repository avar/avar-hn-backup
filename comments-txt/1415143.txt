I still remember learning Emacs for the first time, it was easy, Just time
consuming.

Sure I'm still learning it (that's the nature of Emacs), but getting started is
easy. Just read the tutorial to get a grasp of the basic commands and concepts,
and as soon as you read about the built-in help system you're good to go.

If you don't know what a key does you just prefix it with do `C-h k` to get
help. If you can't recall the keybindings do `C-h b`, and if you've forgotten
all of this do `C-h ?`. The entire manual is just a `C-h r` away.

The built-in documentation makes it really easy to learn more, it just takes
patience.
