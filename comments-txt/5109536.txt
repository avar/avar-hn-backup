Open comment to Internet Activists, Journalists and Academics: You're not going
to get what you want by piggy-backing on Microsoft's proprietary platform.
Specifically if you're an Internet Activists you shouldn't be relying on some
company's proprietary tool for disguising your communications.

There's plenty of open and secure VoIP clients which coupled with open
encryption standards, VPN's etc. will suit your purposes. Use those things, not
Skype.
