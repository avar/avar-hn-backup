Is there anything to suggest that they'll let the current development hell
continue? They have a lot invested in Java now, they might actually get their
act together and push Java forward. Both to make it attractive to the
programmers that like C# better, and to add features to the JVM to allow
alternate languages to thrive, e.g. tail-calls and coroutines.
