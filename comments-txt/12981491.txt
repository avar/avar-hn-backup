Maybe one a month. Usually "We saw your profile on GitHub which matches <our
vague search criteria> and would you be interested in <hackathon/conference/
somesuchthing>?".

To hijack your comment for my own follow-up question. I'm in the EU
(Netherlands). Many of these mails are clearly mass E-Mails with just my name
as a template sent by some US-based company, they'll include an unsubscribe
link for future E-Mails, but aren't unsolicited mass-marketing E-Mails like
these illegal in the EU, and if so would it be worthwhile reporting them, and
who to?
