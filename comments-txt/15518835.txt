No, I believe you're missing the point.

What the article is asserting and what the science shows is that even if you
have Avacados being grown literally next door the environmental impact of
buying them locally is often higher than shipping them from abroad.

For example, the SGU podcast they link to [1] (around 55m:50s in) discusses
that the net environmental impact (carbon emissions) of shipping beef to the UK
from New Zealand is less than consuming UK beef in the UK. So if you're an
environmentally conscious UK consumer you should be spending extra to buy NZ
beef instead of buying locally produced beef.

This is because the carbon impact of the transportation generally hovers around
10%, which leaves the other 90% for actually producing the product "locally",
and some locations on earth are vastly more efficient by every environmental
metric in growing certain crops or raising certain livestock.

From the podcast: "An acre of land in Idaho can produce twice the amount of
potatoes as an acre of land in Kansas".

Which leaves two reasons to buy locally.

Firstly you may be living in one of the places that's efficient at producing a
given product, e.g. you'd buy local beef in New Zealand instead of importing it
from the UK.

Secondly there are certain products that don't ship well, e.g. heirloom
tomatoes. There you simply don't have the option of buying anything except
local varieties.
