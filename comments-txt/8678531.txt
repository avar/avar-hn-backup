Isn't one of the main advantages of IRC that it's still a true federated
protocol? I.e. you can host a channel #foobar across 10 servers and that
channel will always survive netsplits (albeit with some number of clients
splitting off), whereas with Jabber some server will always have to be the sole
host of that channel?
