Ask them how they would, on a Unix system, do some task that's trivially done
via a standard POSIX shell command.

E.g. "how would you count the number of lines in a file?", "given a regex,
please print lines in a file matching the regex", "given N lines, sort them by
numeric value" etc.

The most egregious over-engineering I see is someone writing a 100 line Python
script for something that could be at most a 100 character shell one-liner with
a couple of pipes between different programs.

If they pass that ask them about a problem that would be trivially solved by
resisting the urge to reinvent make, a HTTP server, or an SMTP server.

Edit: Re downthread: Yes obviously only in the context of someone expected to
know *nix in the case of those examples. But the general approach is very
transferable.

Ask the candidate about some trivial problem solvable in 1 minute with standard
tooling they use every day, you'd be amazed at the architecture astronauts that
come out of the woodworks keen to waste their time on some needlessly
over-engineered solution.
