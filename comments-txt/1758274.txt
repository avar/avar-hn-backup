I don't see the moral problem this article hints at. The film is rated PG-13,
not the concept of Avatar or the merchandise.

And given the comments about True Lies any subversion of the rating system
sounds like a great thing. Obviously otherwise excellent movies are being made
into mediocre crap so that they can reach a wider audience and rake in more
money.
