I don't think "downplaying it's [sic] willingness to cooperate" is at all a
fair summary.

They run iButt which is an entirely different matter as far as complying with
subpoenas goes, especially when the subject of the subpoena is dead and the
subject of an investigation.

What are they going to do? Tell the FBI and a judge that they're refusing to
grant them access to unencrypted photos taken by the dead subject of a mass
shooting investigation? There's no way they can do that.

It's quite another thing to be forced to develop exploits for hardware that's
someone else's property just because you're the manufacturer of that hardware.
