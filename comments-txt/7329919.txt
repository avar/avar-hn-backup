I work at Booking.com. We don't use RoR but yeah, we have plenty of frontend
positions open: https://workingatbooking.com I'm also happy to answer any of
your questions, my E-Mail contact is in my profile.

But aside from where I work more generally there's lots of companies in more
stable countries in Europe (or elsewhere) that would be willing to hire a
competent developer of whatever skills you might have.

I just wanted to point out to you that you'd have a much easier time if you
could get a work visa and work your way towards permanent residence or
citizenship than starting out trying to request asylum.
