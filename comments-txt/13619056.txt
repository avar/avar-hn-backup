But in some ways so much easier. I remember how I treated the Internet before I
had a 24/7 connection. I'd make lists of stuff I needed, use my time on the
Internet effectively, learn from the material I downloaded and use that to
inform my next browsing session.

Whereas now there's so many distractions, case in point me posting on this
website right now.
