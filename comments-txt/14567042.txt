As opposed to the current state of affairs where the West just outsources its
dangerous pollution to poorer countries, with health care systems even less
prepared to take care of those sick employees?

This line of argument seems to have more to do with nationalism than concern
for overall human safety.

Yes, ideally nobody would have to suffer from toxic exposure in the workplace,
but the situation we're in right now is that strict Western regulations just
lead to more sick people on the other side of various nation-state fences.

Given that, it's not at all clear to me that declawing an institution like the
EPA is a bad thing. This pollution is happening right now on Earth, is the US
better prepared to deal with it than e.g. Vietnam? Probably. But I'd love to
hear some arguments on this topic that aren't essentially nationalistic
NIMBY-ism.
