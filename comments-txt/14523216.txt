Just some honest feedback on your pricing that's hopefully helpful: Your
Enterprise plan is at least an order of magnitude more expensive than what many
organizations would pay for something like this.

E.g. a Jira license for 2000 people costs $24,000 yearly[1], licensing this for
the same amount of users would be $1,200,000.

This is way more than organizations of that size tend to pay for top-tier
support contracts for software that's critical to business continuity.

Pricing per-user without any advertised discounts is also a trap if you're
selling to large organizations. A lot of them tend to, for simplicity's sake,
want to just give everyone in the org access to a tool like this, but only
5-10% of the workforce might be using it, but due to how you're pricing it
there's no way it's going to be bought in the first place.
