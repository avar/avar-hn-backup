Why don't you just shell out to Emacs for the things you need?

E.g. I have a Git repository that hosts an Org-mode file, when you push to it
emacs is invoked on the server and converts the file to a HTML file that serves
as a shared TODO / Bug list.

You don't have to use Emacs for everything to use Org, just have it export the
data you need from the text you're editing in your $EDITOR of choice.
