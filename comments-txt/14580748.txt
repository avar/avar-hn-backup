This also applies for the perl version they shipped, perl releases are
supported for 3 years, Debian for 5.

It's inevitable that you're going to get mismatches between OS support and
"official" support for the specific packages that go into that release. Not all
projects provide supported releases over a period of years, so distros just do
their best to patch any issues that upstream has stopped caring about past that
point.

In practice the only thing that's going to be a big worry are new security
issues, which upstream is usually willing to go out of their way to fix for
versions still used in the wild, even for technically "unsupported" releases,
at least the Perl project is, I don't know about Python.
