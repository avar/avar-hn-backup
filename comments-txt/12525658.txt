How is Leah Rowe (the Libreboot maintainer) in a position to know better than
the FSF why the FSF fired someone?

Is she directly involved? Does/did she also work for the FSF with the people in
question, or does she just have some relationship with the person who got fired
and is getting their side of the story?

She's now publicly calling for the firing of several people of the FSF & the
destruction of their livelihoods and careers.

I have no involvement in any of this, but as someone on the sidelines who's
been reading about it here on HN this just seems like he said she said hearsay
resulting in the tech equivalent of tabloid dramas & trials in the court of
public opinion.
