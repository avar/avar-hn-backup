Yes as I pointed out you don't want this if you're doing NFS.

Personally I prefer something like a MySQL table with GET_LOCK() to process
things instead of NFS if I need multiple machines. It gives you flock() like
semantics in that if a machine or client goes away the GET_LOCK() is
automatically freed, i.e. it survives as long as the connection to the database
survives.

Not having to deal with stale locks generally sucks way less than the extra
overhead of a database.

For any NFS-based scenario you usually end up creating a "task" "task.underway"
and "task.done" files as locks, and re-enqueuing tasks if you have a "underway"
file that's too old without a "done" file.

You'd do the same with a MySQL table that you GET_LOCK() on, except you can
safely re-enqueue "underway" tasks if you acquire the lock on them, since you
know their consumers have gone away.
