Maybe you're right about them doing a check. It's been a while since I
contacted a US representative (and I didn't claim to be a US citizen) but I
remember that at the time I could simply enter any address / zip code in his/
her contact form, so you could have easily claimed to be from their state.

And regarding the legality remember that this would be a foreign national
contacting a US representative. It's not like they're going to go to the
trouble of finding out who you really are and extraditing you for such a small
matter.
