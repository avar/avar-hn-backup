Sure, I mean that comment in the context of Debian. Debian GNU/kFreeBSD isn't
going to be a replacement for FreeBSD any time soon for the people that prefer
it.

But it's an excellent alternative for Debian users who'd like to use ZFS and
other FreeBSD features without throwing the rest of Debian out with the
bathwater.

This'll also be wonderful for the BSD's in terms of increasing the portability
of packages in Debian that they might want to pick up.
