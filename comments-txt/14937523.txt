It's curious that you leave the US out of your list of nation states that tend
to attract particularly low-effort comments around here. In my experience this
is way more pronounced with the US than any other country that's discussed on
HN.

Of course any country that's discussed here is likely to attract people from
that country who feel they have something to explain or defend, but due to the
userbase being predominantly American the bias is very much towards the US, not
India, Russia, China or whatever.
