I've been using clang 2.7 instead of GCC for a few months now. I'm never going
back to GCC:

* It has much better diagnostics messages: http://clang.llvm.org/
diagnostics.html

* Compilation times are much faster, even though I always wrap gcc/clang with
ccache.

* It uses a lot less CPU / memory on equivalent compile options.

The only disadvantage is that compared to GCC 4.4 the resulting binaries are
usually around 5-10% slower. The LLVM developers say that's to be expected,
currently they're targeting GCC 4.2 for their performance metrics.
