From the article:

    Of particular concern is that Obnam has a theoretical collision
    potential, in that if a block has the same MD5 hash as another
    block, it will assume they are the same. This behaviour is the
    default, but can be mitigated by using the verify option. I tried
    with and without, and interestingly did not notice any speed
    difference (2 seconds, which is statistically insignificant) and
    also did not encounter any bad data on restoration. So I don't
    know why it's off by default.

Worrying about this violates Taylor's Law of Programming Probability[1]:

    The theoretical possibility of a catastrophic occurrence in your
    program can be ignored if it's less likely than the entire
    installation being wiped out by meteor strike.

I've seen a lot of sysadmins or programmers nitpick systems that have the
theoretical possibility of md5 or sha1 collisions, but it's amazingly unlikely
to happen in something like a backup system where you're backing up your own
data, and not taking hostile user data where the users might be engineering
collisions:
