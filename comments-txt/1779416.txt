There's also the unspoken assumption that once you find out you're going to die
you're going to drop everything, tour the world, meet up with all your loved
ones etc. But that's a very Disney-esque view of the world.

We all know we're going to die in 20-60 years. I don't see why people that know
they're going to die in 6 months or 2 years from now should be expected to
behave any differently than the rest of us.

There's certainly a place for getting your affairs in order, but spending the
rest of your days feeling sorry for yourself is a bad waste of time as far as
I'm concerned.
