It likely wasn't anything particularly organized. When I was growing up in the
early 90s in a small fishing village in Iceland I remember that Russian ships
would dock from time to time to sell hundreds of used cars from the Soviet
Union.

I wouldn't be surprised if this specimen arrived in Iceland like that.
