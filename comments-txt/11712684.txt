I wonder if TBL would have written the same article 10 years later when search
engines had gotten much better.

It's still an inconvenience when a URL moves, but before the likes of Google
that used to be a huge inconvenience and it would often take tens of minutes to
track down the new location, now it's on the order of tens of seconds at most.
