Okey, but prepere for some super-lame ad-hoc code. Also I was misremembering
about it handling multiple repos, in the one place where I have >1 I just do
that manually.

My .bashrc will run a bootstrap_work_dotfiles function when bash starts: https:
//github.com/avar/dotfiles/blob/master/.bashrc#L410

This then clones my ~/g/avar-dotfiles-work repo if I'm at work and it hasn't
been cloned: https://github.com/avar/dotfiles/blob/master/.bashrc#L355

I have a "dud" function (dotfile update) function that'll update both, it
basically does a git pull, re-chmods ~/.ssh/config: https://github.com/avar/
dotfiles/blob/master/.bashrc#L381

And also, and what you asked for, removes any stale symlinks via this
one-liner: https://github.com/avar/dotfiles/blob/master/.bashrc#L348

Basically doing a find on my ~ directory and finding any broken links pointing
to the known location of the overlay repo.

I see now that there's a potential bug in it where it narrows its search in
such a way that it could miss it if you add/remove new ~/.??* files. This could
be solved, but I have it like that because I only ever add/remove stuff in e.g.
~/.bashrc.d/ or ~/.screenrc.d/, so this way the find takes less time to run.

Then I have a generated one-liner that I can paste into new machines that
clones my dotfiles.git into ~/g/, moves the .git to ~/, then sources bashrc
which bootstraps the rest.
