They've already had Dragon flights where they've said "if there were humans
aboard, they'd have been just fine", i.e. the Dragon's life-support
capabilities have been tested.

You don't have to have flown humans to test whether you can fly humans, you
know you were able to maintain a breathable atmosphere, and you know you have
enough fuel to launch a few hundred kilos of meatbags, food & water.
