Personally I don't see much reason why we shouldn't aggressively terraform
Mars, including bombarding it with ice-rich asteroids to thicken the
atmosphere.

Having to walk around in space suits indefinitely if you want to go outside
sucks, even just getting the atmosphere to a point where you won't suffer
bruising from decompression if you go out with a face mask would be a huge
improvement.

Why would you want to keep it as it is?
