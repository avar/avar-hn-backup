Aside from the topic at hand, this question shows a great deal of ignorance
about how laws are written.

It's not like there's some independent agency or submission process where
people can submit completed bills, which'll only get picked up or not depending
on special interests. So we could somehow review the difference between laws
that got picked up and passed v.s. those who didn't as some check on
corruption.

Rather, the laws don't get written to begin with if they don't align with
special interests, that's how pervasive they are.
