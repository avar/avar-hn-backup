I happily admit my ignorence on this issue, but after some quick searching I
couldn't find any demographic maps of Sunni/Shia populations that didn't
exactly overlap with the current conflict-areas between Sunni/Shia in the
Middle-East:

I.e. where else in the world is there a mixed Sunni/Shia population? Nowhere?
Isn't that what's different about the Middle-East in this regard?
