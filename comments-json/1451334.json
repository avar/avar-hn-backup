  "text" : "What football (I'm European) needs is much larger penalties for feigning injuries and taking dives.<p>There's a good reason you see players rolling around on the pitch like bruised 4 year old girls, it's beneficial in the long run to the player feigning injury. You're more likely to win a beneficial free kick from it than two yellow cards in a row, so the practice continues.<p>Some national football associations (e.g. Italy) start training kids to do this at a young age.<p>It would probably stop overnight if a player seen taking a dive were to directly receive a red card, or a three game ban.",
