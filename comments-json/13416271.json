  "text" : "Organic isn&#x27;t the answer, it&#x27;s trying to address some legitimate concerns, but it&#x27;s a movement full of scientific woo-woo that&#x27;s been legislated.<p>For instance, organic farming thinks GMO&#x27;s are bad, but is just fine with irradiating large fields full of plants to accomplish random mutations through radiation breeding.<p>This article is one example of this, the author decries traditional corn fields, and as a counterexample wants us to believe that some hilly permaculture farm in Austria which just from the looks of it obviously has to be harvested &amp; maintained by hand would be a viable replacement.<p>Organic is largely just a western luxury product supported by people with no concern about producing food at true scale, and how we can satisfy the global food supply without impoverishing a large part of the population by doing manual labor on farms.<p>There&#x27;s no panacea when it comes to farming, but GMOs seem to be the best shot we have.",
