  "text" : "Everything is like this, just earlier today there was a &quot;Air Travelers Resisting the ‘Incredible Shrinking Airline Seat’&quot; thread[1] here where if the comments are to be believed a huge number of people simply don&#x27;t travel anymore because the seats are so horrible. Surely nobody would want to fly anymore!<p>Meanwhile the airline industry has been growing consistently for decades.<p>Similarly, surely nobody would ever pay $80 for some in-game feature in an EA game. If you aren&#x27;t selling EA stock now in anticipation of their inevitable demise you&#x27;re a fool!<p>Stated preferences are very different from revealed preferences.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=15684552\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=15684552</a>",
