This meme that we&#x27;re all under sealevel is common, but wrong.<p>While literally true in <i>some</i> areas is extremely misleading in the context of a discussion about how rising sealevels impact world cities in general. Your Wikipedia source shows that the elevation goes as low as -2 meters, not that that&#x27;s the mean elevation of the city.<p>Here&#x27;s an elevation map of Amsterdam:<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.floodmap.net&#x2F;Elevation&#x2F;ElevationMap&#x2F;?gi=2759794\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.floodmap.net&#x2F;Elevation&#x2F;ElevationMap&#x2F;?gi=2759794</a><p>And here&#x27;s one of The Netherlands:<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.floodmap.net&#x2F;Elevation&#x2F;CountryElevationMap&#x2F;?ct=NL\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.floodmap.net&#x2F;Elevation&#x2F;CountryElevationMap&#x2F;?ct=NL</a><p>Now I happen to live -1 below in Amsterdam, but I&#x27;m the exception. Most of Amsterdam is above sealevel, the average seems to be around 6-10 meters above.<p>But most importantly, the elevation profile of the entire country is one where the coast is much higher than sealevel, and then gradually slopes downwards to bits of the interior that are entirely landlocked, but are say 1 meter below sealevel. In other words we have pockets of land that are below sealevel, but they&#x27;re surrounded by and protected by land that&#x27;s not.<p>There&#x27;s pretty much zero overlap between where Amsterdam has been sited for the last 800 years and the areas that are anywhere near being under sealevel.",
