  "text" : "The whole theory of personal liberties collapses once you consider sufficiently powerful technology.<p>If there was a drug that gave the user unimaginable euphoria or was guaranteed to kill them with a 50&#x2F;50 chance should we do everything in our power to stop that? Especially for the young and impressionable? Even as someone who thinks heroin should be legal that gives me pause.<p>Should knifes for personal use be legal to purchase? How about guns? How about artillery? Tanks? Nuclear weapons?<p>I don&#x27;t know, but thinking about these issues in absolutes like &quot;personal liberties&quot; tends to bring you some bad places, just like any other absolute. I think it&#x27;s more useful to think about the practical implications of our actions given existing data, which shows the current drug war clearly isn&#x27;t working, but that doesn&#x27;t mean we shouldn&#x27;t ever have any sort of ban on substances purely intended for personal use for public health reasons.",
