Whether those issues are interleaved data, slowing down the N writers or having to keep outsized buffers on the OS level.<p>Even if you have no knowledge of POSIX filesystems you should be able to reason about this in an intelligent way in an interview.<p>Do we go for locks? That has its own set of problems, what are those? Do we go for fixed sized non-interleaved guarantees? What problems does that cause? Do we buffer arbitrarily sized output and and merge it later etc.",
