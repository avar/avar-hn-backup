Millions of people who aren't from the U.S. use those platforms, so clearly most Internet users don't find that using sites aimed at multiple nationalities is in any way troublesome.<p>I'm not saying it won't work, I'm just wondering why you're planning on targeting one specific demographic in particular? I remember when nation-specific sites were much more common, now that's increasingly not the case. If you think your architecture / notification system etc. is going to be better you'd be doing yourself a disservice by making it overly narrow.<p>Anyway. I don't mean to be dismissive of your idea. But to me it sounds a lot like \"I want to set up a discussion forum for my country\". Without any of the details about why your countrymen would sign up, what they're using <i>now</i> to communicate and why they'd be motivated to switch to your platform.",
