IIRC packages have to be 2 weeks in unstable without bugs before migrating to testing.<p>So it&#x27;s explicitly not a bleeding edge release, but a preparation release for the next stable, which is why testing since late-2016 or so hasn&#x27;t been getting any new major releases, it&#x27;s been undergoing release prep.<p>Maybe there should be a sixth branch of Debian between unstable and testing that doesn&#x27;t slow down the migration of packages bug-free for 2 weeks from unstable around release, but that seems like a lot of maintenance burden to impose on Debian.",
