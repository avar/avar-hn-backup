But there&#x27;s also occasionally news from Japan of &quot;Japan Rail [..] charg[ing] families of suicide victims more than US $2 million&quot; e.g. covered in this reddit thread:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;todayilearned&#x2F;comments&#x2F;1khj2n&#x2F;til_in_japan_if_you_commit_suicide_by_jumping_in&#x2F;cbp2r95\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;todayilearned&#x2F;comments&#x2F;1khj2n&#x2F;til_i...</a><p>So I can definitely see how this makes perfect sense when it comes to doing &quot;damage&quot; to apartments (even if only due to reputation &#x2F; superstition) if there are direct guarantors, but as the news about JR show there must be something deeper going on here.",
