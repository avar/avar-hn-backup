  "text" : "Funny how a lot of Americans think banning chewing gum is oppressive but don&#x27;t realize the similarity in the USA entirely banning Kinder Surprise eggs.<p>Lots of arbitrary stuff is banned in a lot of countries. Singapore just thought the littering cons of gum outweighed the pros.<p>Note that stuff like nicotine gum and other &quot;therapeutic&quot; chewing gum is still allowed, they just don&#x27;t allow the candy that leads to littering.<p>And honestly looking around in a lot of cities where the entirety of downtown is slowly growing into a white blob composed of little individual pieces of squashed chewing gum I don&#x27;t blame them.",
