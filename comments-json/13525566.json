  "text" : "I also grew up with subtitles, and I agree they&#x27;re the best compromise when you don&#x27;t understand the dialog. But I never acquired the skill to ignore them once I understood what was being subtitled at a native level, and I really don&#x27;t really understand how anyone could.<p>The human vision is drawn to quick changes &amp; movement, when you have an otherwise immobile scene that&#x27;s mostly just dialog subtitles will pop in &amp; out, I can&#x27;t help but focus on them just like I would if something else suddenly popped into the scene.<p>If you have words pop into your vision you also can&#x27;t help but read them, at least I can&#x27;t, subconsciously reading the translation and hearing the original version at the same time is really distracting.<p>I found the only way to deal with them was to position myself behind some sofa so I could only watch the top 3&#x2F;4 of the screen, but of course you miss a big part of the movie that way.",
