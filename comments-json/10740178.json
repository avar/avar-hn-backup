  "text" : "<p><pre><code>    &gt; I doubt Wikimedia Deutschland would fare well\n    &gt; if their US-based parent organisation disregarded\n    &gt; rulings of German courts.\n</code></pre>\nWell, this has always been the interesting case with these lawsuits against Wikipedia&#x2F;Wikimedia. The local chapters do not in any way run their respective language editions. After all, why would the Wikimedia Germany and not the Austria or Switzerland chapter run the German Wikipedia?<p>Even if the heat was turned up on Wikimedia Deutschland as a result of something like this they&#x27;d be unable to dictate what goes into their language editions of Wikipedia. The local chapters simply have nothing to do with the editorial policy.<p>There are plenty of German speakers who edit Wikipedia who live outside of Germany, some even live in the U.S. Is a German court ruling going to decide whether a German speaker living in the U.S. can insert factual information into a U.S.-hosted encyclopedia article about some subject pertinent to Germany?<p>The entire legal framework around this sort of thing is based on the assumption of locally published paper media, and it&#x27;s really interesting to see how these cases are treated in the Internet age where it&#x27;s not a case of local publishing in your country, but your citizens fetching foreign-published information over international boundaries.<p>So I&#x27;m genuinely curious to know what their standing in the case was considered to be.",
