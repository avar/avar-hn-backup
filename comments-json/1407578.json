The only thing I could find was this from 2007 where it was ~2 orders of magnitude slower: <a href=\"http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.internals/2007/09/msg40359.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.internals/2007/09/...</a><p>The URL to the benchmark script was broken so I couldn't run it.<p>Don't get me wrong, I think Parrot's very neat. But I could see why compiler implementors would be sceptical of it since it's not feature complete, and seemingly not very optimized. So there's a lot of unknowns.",
