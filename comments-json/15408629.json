  "text" : "Norway and Iceland don&#x27;t need to become full EU members for a China FTA creating conflicts between them and the EU. There&#x27;s already overlap between products covered under Iceland&#x27;s FTA with China and its FTA with the EU&#x2F;EEA, but in practice it doesn&#x27;t matter much because any gains from lower import duties are negated by expensive shipping from Iceland.<p>If Norway signs a similar agreement an EEA country with open land borders with the EU will have a FTA with China. At that point the EU would either need to never liberalize certain trade with the EEA least Norway become a shipping and distribution hub for Chinese goods into the EU, or accept that to get closer integration with Norway and the other EEA members.<p>There has been increasing liberalization of trade between the EU and EEA members, just last month the EU and Iceland agreed to drop almost all import duties on agricultural products[1].<p>In addition to all of that, with global warming gearing up the Northeast Passage[2] might become a viable shipping route between China and Europe, at that point shipping from China to Norway will be the shortest shipping route between China and Europe by far. Sailing from China to Europe via the NEP to Norway cuts time at sea and fuel consumption by more than half compared to going via the Suez Canal.<p>1. <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.europarl.europa.eu&#x2F;news&#x2F;en&#x2F;press-room&#x2F;20170911IPR83504&#x2F;eu-to-boost-trade-with-iceland\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.europarl.europa.eu&#x2F;news&#x2F;en&#x2F;press-room&#x2F;20170911IPR...</a><p>2. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Northeast_Passage\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Northeast_Passage</a>",
