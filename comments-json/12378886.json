Which doesn&#x27;t sound that scary, does it?<p><pre><code>    &gt; This is no market solution (the strongest wins)\n</code></pre>\nIf the strongest was really winning to the detriment of everyone else they could just stop participating in the trade agreement.<p><pre><code>    &gt; This is extortion and the loss of the rule of law.\n</code></pre>\nSo the rule of law can only exist on the national level, and can&#x27;t be enforced by an international body that nation-states have agreed to enact? To me that sounds very much like how courts are enacted by states, which most people consider part of the rule of law.",
