I.e. say it took 30 minutes to get from 0% to 80%, but really you went from 30% to 80%, the car just shuts down at 30%.<p>They already have firmware unlocked battery capacity in their currently shipping cars, so this isn&#x27;t some wild conjuncture. The margins on these vehicles are huge, they can just decide they&#x27;d like to pay for marketing by cutting into some of those and shipping more batteries with each vehicle.",
