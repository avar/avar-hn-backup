I doubt the car is just going to screech to a halt via some hardware switch, think about the danger of someone pressing that while in the center lane of a highway.<p>Instead it&#x27;s probably synonymous with giving the software a &quot;stop now&quot; command. I.e. it would know to safely pull over to the side of the road, or take the next off-ramp in that situation.<p>So if someone had hacked the driving software that could be overridden.<p>I do think idibidiart is being overly alarmist. Self-driving cars don&#x27;t have to be perfect, and there could certainly be malicious hacking incidents, but they&#x27;re highly likely to outnumber the cases where people die now due to imperfect human drivers.",
