It&#x27;s seems way more logical and everyone recognizes this on some level.<p>If I shoot you purely by accident most people will agree that I shouldn&#x27;t go to prison. It was an accident, I&#x27;m not a danger to society.<p>If I mean to murder you but my aim is off, or modern medical science manages to keep you from death, how is society better off exactly by keeping me in prison for a shorter time just because I wasn&#x27;t successful?<p>The rational reason to put people in prison in the first place is because we consider them a danger to society. Am I less of a danger to society just because I was slightly incompetent on my first murder attempt?",
