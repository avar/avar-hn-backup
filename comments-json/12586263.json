Developed western\ncountries sell expensive hunting tags for large animals.<p>Are elephants stuck in some economical limbo where it&#x27;s too expensive\nto raise them but too tempting to kill them in the wild? Or is profitable culling simply rejected out of hand for moral reasons that aren&#x27;t applied to similar animals in the west (e.g. bears).",
