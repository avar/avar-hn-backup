Both the SR-71 and the YF-12 were developed from the A-12, which was purely a reconnaissance aircraft: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_A-12\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lockheed_A-12</a><p>The whole concept of using the &quot;Blackbird&quot; family of planes as interceptors was an experimental offshoot that was quickly cancelled, the SR-71 certainly wasn&#x27;t developed as some byproduct of an interceptor, it it was the other way around, the interceptor was a failed offshoot of the reconnaissance aircraft.",
