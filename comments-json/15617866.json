  "text" : "I think PM brought wide attention to it, but it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s just some fringe theory of theirs, see e.g. this CBS report [1] from 2012 (after the PM article was published) with Captain Chesley Sullenberger (of the 2009 Hudson crash fame). Many aviation experts have weighed in on this.<p>Yes they don&#x27;t have all the data, but they have enough to draw this sort of conclusion, including flight path, status of the plane at any given point, and the cockpit transcripts.<p>And true. Suggesting the fleet would be grounded was hyperbolic on my part. But I stand by my general point. Aside from happened in this accident, you&#x27;re assuming that anything worthwhile to be learned from a given incident must be covered in the final report, or it must not be worth considering at all.<p>This expects too much of accident investigators, and doesn&#x27;t account for the sort of institutional blindness that happens when everyone is used to things being done a certain way. Of course that was pilot error, two disconnected joysticks are just how planes are flown!<p>This wasn&#x27;t the first case of an incident being attributed to Airbus&#x27;s overdesigned flight controls, QF72 [2]. comes to mind.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?time_continue=62&amp;v=kERSSRJant0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?time_continue=62&amp;v=kERSSRJant0</a><p>2. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Qantas_Flight_72\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Qantas_Flight_72</a>",
