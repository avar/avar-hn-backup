However just having compelled ID changes even that situation. If Germany didn&#x27;t have that I&#x27;d probably been able to just pay the fine on the spot without need to establish my identity.<p>I don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s anything equivalent to that in the US. Furthermore since there&#x27;s no national ID system they don&#x27;t even know if you have a driver&#x27;s license, social security number or passport, so their options for compelling you to produce ID are limited.",
