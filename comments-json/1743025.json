  "text" : "Why do you limit a reasonable amount of time to a human lifetime? If we're going to colonize interstellar space with anything like our current technology we're probably going to have to ditch that requirement.<p>There's no reason you can't have a multi-generational ship that takes a thousand years to arrive. You don't have to send thousands of people either, it's enough to send a hundred or so, have them populate on the way, and maybe send some frozen sperm &#38; eggs with them to increase genetic diversity.<p>Another possibility that'll probably become viable within 50-200 years is to not send any humans at all, but to only send a fast &#38; small ship with human sperm &#38; eggs that can start hatching humans once it gets there. Raising the infants could be done with robots and other infrastructure manufactured once we get there.",
