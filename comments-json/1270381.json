  "text" : "I also switched to Dvorak due to RSI issues on a QWERTY layout. It's not a substitute for taking typing breaks and improving the circulation in your hands but it helps a lot.<p>I recommend trying for a day or so. Even after a few hours of use it's obvious that you're doing less work to type the same things. In 3 weeks your typing speed should be tolerable (capable of conversing on IRC) and in 3 months you should be up to full speed.<p>I don't type any faster on Dvorak than I used to. It's just more comfortable for my hands.",
