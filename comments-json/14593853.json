  "text" : "The UK has an entirely different governmental structure than the EU, so comparing why someone votes for an MEP v.s. UK MP makes no sense.<p>Of course MEPs are going to need to consider the EU as a whole, because in order to advance the goals of their constituencies they need to cooperate  with the MEPs representing everyone else (and other EU institutions).<p>But expecting that you can ban MEPs from being a product of national politics or national political branding would be folly and undemocratic. That&#x27;s what the EP is for, it&#x27;s there to represent voting blocks within the nation-states that make up the EU, MEPs are explicitly not voted for across national boundaries.<p>Targeting MEPs to solve a perceived &quot;democratic deficit&quot; in the EU seems bizarre. They&#x27;re the only directly elected institution, and they&#x27;re the most locally accountable EU representatives or institution.<p>It seems to me what you&#x27;d like to accomplish here would be better solved by making the 28 members of the Commission directly elected across national boundaries by the entirety of EU citizens.",
