  "text" : "If the offer is annual and they add an extra $1000 per year then on average the disgruntled employee has to wait 6 months to quit and get a higher severance, not 1 year. Which means that 1&#x2F;4 of those employees only have to churn through 3 more months to get an extra $1000, hardly something nobody would do.<p>The obvious solution to fix this flaw in the system would be to raise the offer daily instead of annually, be approximately $1000&#x2F;365 =~ $2.74 per day. Or more simply by $20 per week, which comes out to about the same per year ($1040).",
