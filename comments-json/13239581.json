  "text" : "It&#x27;s been some time but I&#x27;ve read the entire report cover-to-cover. While yes, the general conclusion is that NASA&#x27;s dysfunctional management structure and institutional optimism driven by moneyed interests is the primary culprit. The report never really tries to perform a root cause analysis on how something like the O-ring &quot;safety factor&quot; problem arose.<p>Something which, as summarized by Feynman&#x27;s quote above, should be patently obvious to any engineer as bullshit.<p>Feynman&#x27;s appendix is the only part that even tries, but it doesn&#x27;t go far enough through no fault of Feynman&#x27;s, he had no resources to pursue this line of inquiry. It was a struggle just to get that appendix into the report.<p>They should have interviewed every single person in any way remotely involved in that O-ring decision, find out if they objected to it, and if they didn&#x27;t what money&#x2F;institutional&#x2F;social obstacles there were to prevent that.<p>Did some engineer actually sign off on the aforementioned &quot;safety factor&quot;? We don&#x27;t know, but somehow I doubt that&#x27;s language management came up with on their own, and if they did that there was no way for an engineer to spot that and report &quot;wtf? The system doesn&#x27;t work like that!&quot;.<p>Reading between the lines some engineer actually did come up with that estimate, but likely that engineer was where he was because NASA had a culture of promoting mindless yes-men.",
