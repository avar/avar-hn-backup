When evaluating source code management systems, I primarily researched the repository structures and essentially ignored the user interface details. We can fix the user interface over time and even add features. We cannot, however, fix a broken repository structure without all of the pain inherent in changing systems.\"<p>Keith makes a good point. While Git's interface is lacking in some areas, those things can be fixed in the higher level porcelain. Picking a system with a nicer interface whose plumbing is uglier will lead to problems further down the road.",
