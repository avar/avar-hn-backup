But I suppose on some non-POSIX platforms you might have more issues, or with some esoteric mount options to screw with mtime or something.<p>The reason it&#x27;s disabled by default is first of all that it&#x27;s relatively new, but secondly that if your FS stops behaving as expected (or you move your repo to one that doesn&#x27;t behave) it&#x27;ll degrade very badly, i.e. &quot;git status&quot; might now completely miss files that have been modified in your working tree.<p>But if you&#x27;re just running a system where you know you can trust the FS you can use the untracked cache and get a lot of &quot;git status&quot; speed-up, which&#x27;ll matter more the larger your checkout size is in terms of checked out directories &amp; files.",
