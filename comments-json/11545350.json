You can also know x, then it&#x27;s a &quot;second-preimage resistance&quot;.[1]<p>Which is not the same as a collision attack. Where you&#x27;re trying to find x and y such that h(x) = h(y) <i>without</i> anyone specifying x or y in advance.<p>By definition a collision attack is an attack where you specifically craft <i>both</i> x and y such that they exploit weaknesses in the algorithm.<p>It&#x27;s not enough to know an arbitrary x or y that someone else has made, because that value isn&#x27;t going to be exploiting the weakness.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Preimage_attack\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Preimage_attack</a>",
