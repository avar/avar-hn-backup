  "text" : "You say you understand the point but you seem to have entirely missed it, the same problem remains.<p>The point of the APM limit is presumably to fairly emulate a human player, but the APMs for humans are obviously averaged over a minute.<p>However, for certain things humans can initiate actions in SC2 in quick succession that, if sustained over a greater time period, would yield a ridiculous APM rate. Think a Terran player highlighting the barracks and tapping &quot;A&quot; really fast, say with a 10ms delay, that would result in 600 APM.<p>Let&#x27;s say a human can build 5 marines like that in quick succession. You&#x27;re going to have to allow for temporary spikes in APM to not unfairly give the human player an advantage.<p>But if you do that the computer is able to really rapidly execute more complex actions that the human can&#x27;t because he&#x27;s limited by the SC2 UI, whereas every action via the API is equally difficult for the computer. E.g. moving 3 different subgroups of marines out of the way of a High Templar Storm. I doubt any human player could select 3 different subgroups of marines from one big group and move them out of the way in 3 different directions within the span of 60ms (10ms for each action of select&#x2F;move for 3x groups).<p>So any &quot;fair&quot; APM limit really needs to be dynamic in some way, or at least take into account the complexity of actions (say highlighting a group v.s. tapping &quot;A&quot;). It&#x27;s not at all obvious how to do this while retaining fairness and not giving either the human or the computer an unfair advantage.",
