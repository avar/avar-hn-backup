I've paid my $5 for it and downloaded\nit, and that link I posted will return a 403 without the right\nauthorization.<p>I posted it because I was worried that I couldn't download it with\nwget before I bought it, I'm on a 3G connection through my phone and I\nwanted to download it to my server so I could download it later from a\nmore capable connection.<p>I sent the below E-Mail to their support address (support@louisck.net)\nand I'd encourage others who bought this to send something similar do\nthe same. I think it's important to tell artists that this sort of\ndistribution is appreciated:<p><pre><code>    Thanks for making this show available in non-DRM format. I haven't\n    watched it yet, but I bought it and downloaded it already.\n    \n    My friends and I have been following your work for a while, I've\n    watched both your HBO TV shows and downloaded a bunch of your\n    standups. But since I don't live in the US and don't want to buy DRM\n    content I haven't paid you for any of this.\n    \n    However I'm happy to be able to when you offer something in this\n    format. I can pay for it even if I don't live in the US, and I don't\n    have to buy something like a DVD or subscribe to something like iTunes\n    where I'll effectively be getting a worse service by locking the media\n    I buy into some corporation's proprietary distribution platform.\n    \n    But if you keep offering things in this way in the future I'll be sure\n    to pay for them.\n    \n    It's not that I'm cheap. I make a very good living, and I'm happy to\n    pay for things. I just think it's unethical to pay for media when part\n    of the proceeds go to conglomerates like the MPAA which are actively\n    working towards reducing freedom on the Internet.</code></pre>",
