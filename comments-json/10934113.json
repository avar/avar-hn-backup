Reusing 9 times cuts the cost to 1&#x2F;3. However, there is little benefit to first stage reuse beyond thatâ€¦ Reusing both stages just once halves the total cost of launch. In addition, reusing both stages four times reduces the cost to 1&#x2F;4, and reusing eight times reduces to 1&#x2F;8.&quot;<p>As you touched upon a lot of things in space are expensive <i>because</i> launch vehicles aren&#x27;t reusable, once they are it makes sense to create cheaper and expandable payloads rather than multi-billion dollar payloads strapped to rockets that can&#x27;t be allowed to fail.",
