  "text" : "I was under the impression that Silk Road wasn&#x27;t a company but a private website run by Ross. Reading over the Wikipedia article and the indictment I can&#x27;t find any mention of it being incorporated.<p>Although the indictment mentions at one point that he had an employee, but he may have been paying him privately and not as part of a corporate structure.<p>Does that change anything vis-a-vis the argument you&#x27;re making with regards to civil disobedience?<p>My reading of your comments is that a corporation doesn&#x27;t have certain rights private individuals have. That makes sense, but does your argument still hold if Silk Road is a purely private website without any corporate structure?<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ia600406.us.archive.org&#x2F;17&#x2F;items&#x2F;gov.uscourts.mdd.238311&#x2F;gov.uscourts.mdd.238311.4.0.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ia600406.us.archive.org&#x2F;17&#x2F;items&#x2F;gov.uscourts.mdd.23...</a>",
