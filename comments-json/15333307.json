  "text" : "The article and its source notes &quot;almost all the staff with expertise on production had retired or left the agency&quot;, they then proceed to spend a little short of 100 million replicating the process.<p>There&#x27;s no mention of any attempt to simply find the people that originally made it and asking them how it was made, since protection was halted in 1989 most of them should still be alive.<p>Surely that would have been more cost efficient than reverse engineering the production process, but of course the government would have had little incentive to save money.<p>So just reading between the lines this is less of a story of how the USA &quot;forgot&quot; something, and more of a story of how some sprawling bureaucracy couldn&#x27;t bring itself to pick up the phone, presumably due to some combination of information siloing, the complexities of re-granting some retirees security clearances etc.",
