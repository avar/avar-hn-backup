Powerusers of Git use rebase <i>extensively</i>, pretty much every patch that makes it into Git itself has been rebased at least half a dozen times.<p>I rewrite my history constantly, because when writing code I commit all the time, then I squash commits together later and give them proper commit messages.<p>I wouldn't use any SCM tool that wouldn't give me this functionality. The result of recording all history permanently is that users will just not commit their incomplete work, meaning that it'll be in their working tree instead of tracked in some form by the repository.",
