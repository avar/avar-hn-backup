The recommendation feature powers the part of YouTube that auto-plays the upcoming video.<p>So e.g. if I go and view Russian dashcam videos they&#x27;re going to automatically play more of them, even though I&#x27;ve shown no prior interest in that topic.<p>Having two systems for recommendations would introduce a lot of UI complexity, so I can see why they didn&#x27;t go for that, and why the recommendations are consequently tuned for people who are actively watching videos on some topic right now.",
