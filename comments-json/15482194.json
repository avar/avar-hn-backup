  "text" : "I spent all of 5 hours in a new Subaru Outback I rented this summer and wasn&#x27;t impressed.<p>I could set the cruise control to a certain speed and it would normally slow down if there was congestion, which was very nice.<p>But it wouldn&#x27;t work at bends in the road, because the system was seemingly just directly ahead line-of-sight. I wanted to see if it would slow down itself in that situation before I had to slam the breaks, it would have plowed into the much slower-moving car ahead of me.<p>So my experience is that while these systems help in bumper-to-bumper traffic on congested highways they&#x27;re still to dangerous to rely on.",
