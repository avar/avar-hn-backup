[...]\n    &gt; So the Earth has a heat stored which is\n    &gt; (4K miles &#x2F; 50 feet)^3\n</code></pre>\nThis seems to assume that the earth is also cube shaped like a hypothetical 50ft^3 blast furnace, instead of a sphere (or oblate spheroid before anyone out-pedants me).<p>It also seems to assume that a 50ft^3 blast furnace contains energy equivalent to 50ft^3 of molten mantle. If you look at diagrams of blast furnaces you can see that a relatively tiny part of them is actually molten material.<p>Not being able to find numbers on the stored joules of industrial blast furnaces, I&#x27;m just going to just state that 50ft^3 of mantle has a crapload more potential energy than 50ft^3 of blast furnace, most of which is air, equipment &amp; empty space, not molten material.<p>He is right that there&#x27;s at least as much energy stored in the earth as he&#x27;s saying, but it&#x27;s going to be a crapload more than that.<p>The insides of blast furnaces are also significantly colder than the average temperature of the mantle.",
