Surely these aren&#x27;t going to be wider than a sidewalk, and in central London the distance between any two roads on a block is rarely more than 50-100 meters.<p>You&#x27;d end up with lots of ventilation grates on the sidewalks on the surface, but that seems like an easy and space efficient solution.",
