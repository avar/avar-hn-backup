UBI is <i>not</i> identical to NIT because the difference is <i>marketing</i>, not <i>math</i>. Most of the electorate&#x27;s basis for evaluating a given policy is not to perform a mathematical comparison of two systems and checking whether they yield the same results. How something is done is as important in politics as what gets done.<p>Which is why, as I&#x27;ve pointed out, BI isn&#x27;t like NIT at all. The difference is how the idea is going to get sold to the public, not what each taxpayer is going to end up contributing to the system as a function of their income.",
