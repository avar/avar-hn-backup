It's been a while since I contacted a US representative (and I didn't claim to be a US citizen) but I remember that at the time I could simply enter any address / zip code in his/her contact form, so you could have easily claimed to be from their state.<p>And regarding the legality remember that this would be a foreign national contacting a US representative. It's not like they're going to go to the trouble of finding out who you really are and extraditing you for such a small matter.",
