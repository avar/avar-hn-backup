The US and its allies aren't directly avenging the deaths of those 3,000 people.<p>Rather it's recognized that if the perpetrators had the chance they would probably have killed 30 thousand, or 3 million. So the public justification for the \"War on Terror\" has been to prevent similar <i>future</i> events.<p>See e.g. this interview with Tony Blair where he makes that exact point:<p><a href=\"http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/tue-september-14-2010/exclusive---tony-blair-extended-interview-pt--1\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/tue-september-14-2010/excl...</a>",
