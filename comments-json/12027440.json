  "text" : "French is currently unique in that it&#x27;s the previous lingua franca, so much so that the term for &quot;world language&quot; in English is a French term.<p>That French is now using loan words from English doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s dying. Have you tried to speak English without French &#x2F; Latin &#x2F; Norse loan words? Good luck.<p>It just means that French is like any other language now, aggressively borrowing from the current world language. Nothing wrong with that.",
