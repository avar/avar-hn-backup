  "text" : "Your observation about diminishing returns is an excellent one, but your comparison about space exploration and movie making doesn&#x27;t make much sense.<p>The reason these people don&#x27;t argue that we shouldn&#x27;t stop making movies until we end world hunger is that (well, most of the time), the making of movies is not funded by the government, but by the private market.<p>It&#x27;s a one thing to to argue that we shouldn&#x27;t do Y at all as a species until we accomplish X (&quot;we shouldn&#x27;t make movies when people are starving&quot;). It&#x27;s very different to argue that maybe the government should completely prioritize X over Y for the purposes of allocating tax money (&quot;let&#x27;s not spend money on space until we can feed everyone&quot;).",
