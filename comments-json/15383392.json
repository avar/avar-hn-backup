  "text" : "Right, I was overly simplifying. I meant to say a 120 sh ton MLC-calculated weight, not a vehicle that&#x27;s exactly 120 tons since as the article goes into the class needs to take into account axle count etc.<p>What I don&#x27;t understand is your claim that &quot;you could just as well consider them metric tons&quot;. These are short tons with caveats, i.e. the eventual number depends on more than just the raw weight, but the raw weight is one aspect of the calculation.<p>So if you were to make that calculation on the basis of metric instead of lbs how aren&#x27;t you going to introduce something like a 10% error in the MLC you come up with?",
