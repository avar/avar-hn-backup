Not all projects provide supported releases over a period of years, so distros just do their best to patch any issues that upstream has stopped caring about past that point.<p>In practice the only thing that&#x27;s going to be a big worry are new security issues, which upstream is usually willing to go out of their way to fix for versions still used in the wild, even for technically &quot;unsupported&quot; releases, at least the Perl project is, I don&#x27;t know about Python.",
