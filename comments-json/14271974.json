  "text" : "Right, but let&#x27;s say for example that some guy X publishes embarrassing classified information on a protest sign that he&#x27;s holding in front of the White House, this could be construed as civil disobedience, right?<p>But it couldn&#x27;t if Google had the same information and published it on its front page, since it&#x27;s a corporation.<p>1. But what if guy X publishes it on his personal blog?<p>2. What if he occasionally sells used goods via his blog?<p>3. What if the main point of the blog is to sell those used goods, with a small &quot;notes from the author&quot; section where the information is published?<p>4. What if it&#x27;s purely a commercial enterprise &amp; isn&#x27;t incorporated?<p>5. And then if it&#x27;s incorporated it should be clear-cut, since as you said &quot;only people [and not corporations] engage in civil disobedience&quot;.<p>My question is when civil disobedience stops being a defense. Your original comment points out that Uber can&#x27;t use that because it falls into #5, but then you&#x27;re saying it wouldn&#x27;t apply to Silk Road either which as far as I can tell falls into #4.<p>How about #1-3?",
