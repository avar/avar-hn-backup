  "text" : "All drugs (weed, cocaine, heroin, amphetamines, etc.) should be as easy to buy as cigarettes are right now. Not for any ideological reason, just that it&#x27;s going to suck a <i>lot</i> less than the status quo which creates black markets and throws addicts into prison.<p>You don&#x27;t get to choose between having drugs and not having drugs. Everywhere in the world has drugs, you just get to choose whether you have an underground criminal black market that the state creates through its policies or not.<p>The whole decriminalization of consumption argument just moves the goalpost. You create the same problem The Netherlands has had with weeds for the past few decades, which is admittedly better than most of the rest of the world, but production remains and unregulated black market.",
