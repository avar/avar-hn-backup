  "text" : "The article doesn&#x27;t make this obvious, but the Michelin Guide just expanded into Singapore this year.<p>Singapore has some amazing food, and the hawker stalls are no exception. If anything they exceed far fancier restaurants with their focus and authenticity.<p>But as far as this being news or worthy of HN goes, this just seems like shameless corporate propaganda, even the video accompanying the article is entirely produced by Michelin.<p>If anything I think the newsworthy aspect of it is why there&#x27;s been literally no street food stall in Michelin&#x27;s established markets deemed good enough for certification? Maybe I just have my guilty pleasures, but there&#x27;s some truly delicious street food to be had in Europe.",
