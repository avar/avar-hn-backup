They&#x27;d have a much bigger practical problem with having to fly it over Russia than Japan.<p>In order for its course to go anywhere near Tokyo they&#x27;d have to be aiming said ICBM somewhere midway around Argentina, around a thousand miles south of Buenos Aires or so.<p>Don&#x27;t let the Mercator projection interfere with your sense of reality.",
