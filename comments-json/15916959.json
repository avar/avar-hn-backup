Either they fund\ntheir own research and publish in prestigious expensive journals that\ncost the public money, or they take public money and make the research\navailable for all.<p>But it&#x27;s not easy to migrate to that because scientist aren&#x27;t just\nusing journals as a publication platform, but as a reputation platform\nas a function of their exclusivity and reputation.",
