  "text" : "There&#x27;s no way that a tidal plant running for 100 years is going to change the day by 1 second. You&#x27;re many orders of magnitudes off.<p>That means that if you built 100 of those plants that in 1 year you&#x27;d change the length of the day by 1 second.<p>The 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami released 3.9×10^22 joules of energy[1] and changed the day by just over a microsecond[2]. A single Tsar Bomba releases 2.1×10^17 joules, so you&#x27;d need the energy of around 200 thousand of those to produce the same amount of energy as the earthquake, and <i>then</i> assuming you can direct that energy you need 1000 times more to shift the day by a second instead of a microsecond.<p>That means that each one of your proposed tidal plants would need to generate the energy of 20,000,000 Tsar Bombas per year.<p>That&#x27;s one Tsar Bomba&#x27;s worth of energy being released every 1.5 seconds at each one of those 100 plants. Buy stock in sunscreen companies now!<p>Each one of your 100 plants would satisfy all of current yearly world energy production in just 30 minutes[3][4].<p>I&#x27;m too lazy to calculate what that would do to the surrounding area, but I&#x27;d wager that they&#x27;re going to severely depress local property prices due much of the surrounding beach-side property area now being turned into permanent molten lava.<p>The good news is you could probably build really good wind power plants now, due to constant hurricane winds not seen on Earth since the K–T impact, but I digress.<p>I didn&#x27;t check your molten rock calculation but given how off your tidal plant calculation is I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it&#x27;s way off as well.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2011_T%C5%8Dhoku_earthquake_and_tsunami#Energy\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2011_T%C5%8Dhoku_earthquake_an...</a><p>2. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nasa.gov&#x2F;topics&#x2F;earth&#x2F;features&#x2F;japanquake&#x2F;earth20110314.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nasa.gov&#x2F;topics&#x2F;earth&#x2F;features&#x2F;japanquake&#x2F;earth2...</a><p>3. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;World_energy_consumption\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;World_energy_consumption</a><p>4.
