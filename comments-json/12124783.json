But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unreasonable in the face of historical evidence to think that the concentration camps would have been treated vastly differently by the allies if the only prisoners were homosexuals, given how the allies treated those prisoners upon their release.<p>Which I think goes to show that the allied forces didn&#x27;t have an intrinsic objection to what went on in the concentration camps, they just minded the target audience the Nazis picked.",
