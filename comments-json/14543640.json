Or in this case, if the program was optimized for simplicity, optimize for throughput.<p>It would have been very easy for the nascent GNU project to unintentionally produce a line-by-line equivalent of BSD yes.c, which would have potentially landed them in the 80&#x2F;90s equivalent of the Google v.s. Oracle case.",
