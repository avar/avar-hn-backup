  "text" : "You&#x27;re conflating collision attacks like the Flame malware with a preimage attack that would be necessary to produce a malicious Ubuntu release with the same MD5SUM.<p>I.e. what&#x27;s &quot;broken&quot; about MD5 is if you have a lot of CPU time and I allow you to give me two unrelated blobs, you can craft those blobs to have the same MD5 sum.<p>What&#x27;s not &quot;broken&quot; (beyond a theoretical 2^123.4 attack) with MD5 and not broken at all for SHA1 is preimage attacks. E.g. if I work for Canonical, make an Ubuntu ISO and you have to produce a malicious ISO with the same MD5 sum.<p>We should be considerate of collision &#x2F; preimage attacks, but please don&#x27;t spread FUD by conflating the two. Publishing MD5 sums for ISOs is just fine.",
