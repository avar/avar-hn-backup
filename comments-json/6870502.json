Even if you think you should have a larger government than you have now the question is <i>what</i> kind of larger government, and once you make the wrong choice there&#x27;s a huge inertia in the system that makes correcting that choice very hard.<p>So even people that agree that government should do more aren&#x27;t easily brought on the bandwagon of the something the government wants to do being the right version of that &quot;more&quot;.",
