That difference is what the entire argument is about.<p>Few people are saying saying &quot;let&#x27;s not do this&quot; for some value of &quot;this&quot;, they&#x27;re saying &quot;let&#x27;s not <i>force everyone</i> to do this&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s a very profound difference, it&#x27;s why having the government make anything its business anywhere in the world is always controversial.",
