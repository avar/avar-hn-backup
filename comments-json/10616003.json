This is obviously a concern, but as others here in the thread have mentioned we could get people willing to accept the risk.<p>The second is that if people stay on Mars for generations you have the risk of cumulative damage to DNA over generations. Now it&#x27;s not just a problem that instead of living to 80 you die of cancer at 60, but rather that after N generations the population&#x27;s DNA might be damaged past repair.",
