  "text" : "I&#x27;d also really like an answer to this. I&#x27;ve read a few articles about the subject that allude to there being such a thing as &quot;clan liability&quot; in Japan but they&#x27;ve never actually gone into any detail on the subject.<p>I know that in feudal Japan personhood effectively didn&#x27;t exist in the form that it does today. You were part of a clan, if you killed someone and died in the process the clan of that someone could extract revenge on your clan. They were the actor, not you.<p>I understand that much of this survives today in the form of shaming, you don&#x27;t just bring shame to yourself, but to your family (clan).<p>But is there actually any legal system in Japan that treats a family or clan as a collective? Can the liabilities of adults that kill themselves be transferred to their family?",
