  "text" : "How will a system like this handle developing news stories after the fact? E.g. in the Qu√©bec mosque shooting there were initially two suspects, and many news articles that had accurate information at the time look incorrect in retrospect. Would those all be marked as BS retroactively by such a system, or is it enough that the news article used the best available facts at the time?<p>How will it handle granularity? It&#x27;s very hard to write any news article that&#x27;s 100% correct about everything. Will the entire article be marked as non-factually accurate due to the slightest mistake, or will they be highlighting specific factual inaccuracies in the content itself?",
