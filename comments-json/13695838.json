  "text" : "I certainly don&#x27;t think every discussion about any fictional work\nneeds to be turned into some Simpsons comic book guy analysis of the\nmost minute of flaws.<p>Most sci-fi or fantasy works have some &quot;gimme&quot; that you just have to\naccept, because it furthers the story. Fine, anti-gravity, time travel\nor whatever exists. Nobody&#x27;s expected to explain how it works.<p>What makes for lazy writing is introducing some world changing concept\nthat you base your entire story on, and then just conveniently leaving\nit out in the very next scene for dramatic effect. That goes beyond having a\ngimme, you&#x27;re just assuming your audience is dumb at that point.<p>I think the book &quot;Story of Your Life&quot; is just fine. It&#x27;s consistent with its premise. As my comment\nindicates it&#x27;s the lazy movie adoption I have a problem with.<p>They depart from the book by making the character capable of changing\nthe future based on her prescience, she&#x27;s no longer just a puppet\nplaying out future events. She&#x27;s got a choice. Okey, fine, let&#x27;s run\nwith that.<p>But then she can see a future where here young daughter dies from some\nincurable disease at a young age, but decides to have her anyway. Her\npartner then leaves her because she went through with that without\ntelling him.<p>I&#x27;d love to be a fly on the wall in the universe of the movie when\nthey had that conversation. He was probably yelling at her that they\ncould have just spent a couple of thousand dollars on sperm sorting &amp;\nIVF and say had a boy instead of instead of having their young\ndaughter die at an early age from some statistically improbable disease.",
