  "text" : "Nobody&#x27;s attributing deaths to single causes. When we say e.g. that coal plants kill N number of people per year it&#x27;s not the case that someone breathed in some coal particulates and keeled over night there at the age of 20.<p>Rather, we know from epidemiological data that certain pollution, foods etc. shorten your life by a given amount. Let&#x27;s say life expectancy is 100 years, living near a coal plant subtracts 5 years from that, and living near a nuclear plant 0. That would mean that out of 20 people living there there was 1 death equivalent a year.",
