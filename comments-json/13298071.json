I can hardly be said to &quot;still&quot; be maintaining some position when my one contribution to this thread as of writing this is a one paragraph comment.<p>I don&#x27;t see how any reading of my one comment here could indicate that I&#x27;m attacking the fundamental existence of unions, which to clarify, I have nothing against.<p><pre><code>    &gt; Why are you still attacking a temporary\n    &gt; solution to a much larger problem?\n</code></pre>\nMy one paragraph comment was simply pointing out, something you failed to address in the grandparent&#x27;s comment, that power structures once enacted tend to stick, and they tend to serve their own ends.<p>Which is not to say that unions can&#x27;t be a net positive for workers employed as part of the union, that obviously depends.<p>But if you&#x27;re being made part of a union&#x27;s purview and they&#x27;ve structured their rules in such a way that you can&#x27;t vote, then it should be fairly obvious that they&#x27;re structurally not interested in representing you, and will in fact represent the interests of voting members at your expense.",
