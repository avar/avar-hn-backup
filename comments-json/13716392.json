  "text" : "Let&#x27;s say a Russian company opens up a chain of coffee shops in the US, has surveillance cameras for theft prevention, keeps various records on its customers etc.<p>Now the Russian government issues a warrant to demand data from the US subsidiary. Do you think that US jurisdiction should have no say in the matter?<p>If the Russians compelled their US subsidiary to hand over the data in violation of US law, how long do you think they&#x27;d be allowed to operate in the US?<p>The end result of this US overreach will be trade wars and the further rise of national enclaves of the Internet. I&#x27;d argue that that&#x27;s not in anyone&#x27;s long term interests, least alone the US&#x27;s.",
