Are you saying that wild game reserves just categorically don&#x27;t work and can&#x27;t preserve wild populations of animals?<p>Do you only think that about Africa (why?) or e.g. also for U.S. National Parks or other areas where you can buy hunting tags?<p>Full disclosure: I don&#x27;t hunt, I have no interested in doing so. I&#x27;m just perplexed that solutions that seem to work in the west to align economic incentives with conservation aren&#x27;t being applied in Africa.<p>And furthermore, when you ask about it you don&#x27;t get any sort of specific answers, but just out of hand dismissive answers seemingly based on motivated reasoning without any explanation of why certain systems would work for animals A in country X, but not animals B in country Y.",
