  "text" : "When I lived in Germany I by mistake didn&#x27;t check into a tram once and was discovered by a ticket inspector. Long story short since I didn&#x27;t have ID on me I ended up getting escorted by two police officers back to my house to show them my passport.<p>So yes, you don&#x27;t have to carry ID on you in Germany, but only in the most pedantic sense. You&#x27;ll just get a free police escort back to where you keep your ID in case you need to identify yourself. That hardly qualifies as not needing to carry ID when going about your business in the sense that Americans would be familiar with.",
