That some sociopath gains access to the perl6 repo and replaces all the code with a shellscript that &quot;sudo rm -rf &#x2F;&quot;&#x27;s?<p>Sure, that&#x27;s possible, but good contributors will vastly outnumber bad contributors, and such a person&#x27;s commit access would be revoked instantly. There&#x27;s still code review for everything, and such a change would not go unnoticed.<p>Just look at Wikipedia. That&#x27;s the equivalent of a publically writeable repo and hasn&#x27;t turned into a total shitshow as a result.<p>As the Perl 6 ecosystem demonstrates you get <i>way</i> more out of inclusiveness than being paranoid about some hypothetical bad actor getting access to your repo.",
