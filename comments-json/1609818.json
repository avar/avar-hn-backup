Then you don't have to forge any SSL certificates, or rely on the browser not yelling enough.<p>The <i>only</i> way to guard against that is to train users to recognize that they shouldn't be sending money through a non-CA SSL connection, as indicated by their browser with a friendly \"Secure\" icon somewhere.<p>Thus, if browsers treated non-CA signed SSL connections just like normal HTTP connections, i.e. just used encryption, didn't present any \"secure\" banners etc. you wouldn't make things any less secure.<p>Non-CA signed SSL traffic is just as secure as unencrypted HTTP traffic (i.e. not), and browsers should treat both of them equivalently.",
