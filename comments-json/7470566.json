  "text" : "What do you mean there aren&#x27;t any laws? You hand people money in exchange for their non-legally binding vague promises. This model of exchange has been around for hundreds if not thousands of years. Legally speaking Kickstarter is nothing new.<p>If I meet someone on the street that promises me to try out some new idea and I give them money the courts aren&#x27;t going to give me any more credence than someone who handed a $50 bill to a bum. How is this in any way a new and novel legal situation?<p>The only thing that&#x27;s new is that now due to the Internet more people have the ability to easily give out their money to potentially stupid initiatives.",
