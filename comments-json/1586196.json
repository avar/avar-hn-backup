Because he opted to support a modular compiler started at the University of Illinois instead of the GCC.<p>The LLVM's license is free, and even classified as such by the FSF. To smear participants in a fellow free software project like this or those that fund it is beyond low.<p>I lost a lot of respect for Moglen after reading that.",
