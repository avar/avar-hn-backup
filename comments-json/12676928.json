  "text" : "This whole thread including this comment feels like people who haven&#x27;t ever been to The Netherlands making suggestions that make no sense for the cycling culture here.<p>So firstly as has been covered in other comments here, cyclists in The Netherlands don&#x27;t want to wear helmets for their daily commuting, it doesn&#x27;t solve any sort of safety problem for them when you factor in the inconvenience they cause.<p>Secondly even if they did most bicycle chains here are over an inch thick, not something you can thread through a bicycle helmet.<p>Sure you could carry some extra wire just to lock the helmet to the bike, but that gets you even further down the road of making a bunch of special accommodations to solve a problem that doesn&#x27;t exist in the first place.",
