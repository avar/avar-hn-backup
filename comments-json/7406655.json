If you don&#x27;t get a Google paycheck it&#x27;s thus very hard to contribute to it as an open project.<p>It&#x27;s faux-open because almost every single Android device needs proprietary kernel blobs &amp; firmware to operate almost any non-trivial hardware feature on the device. In practice this pins you to specific kernel versions&#x2F;APIs, and you&#x27;re running code you can&#x27;t change or even audit.",
