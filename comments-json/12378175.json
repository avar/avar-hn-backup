  "text" : "Is it really a bad example? The typical scare story about trade agreements seems to be that they&#x27;re going to result in some big scary multinational shutting off the water supply or something.<p>Is that really the common case or even all that plausible? Or is it just going to be normal businesses like Apple colliding with some country&#x27;s protectionist policies that are counter to the trade agreement?<p>Besides, if these supposed kangaroo courts are really so unfair the aggrieved countries could just leave the TTIP.<p>That seems to be another detail that&#x27;s glossed over, that somehow these pan-national arbitration bodies are going to be corrupt, but not quite so corrupt that the trade agreement isn&#x27;t an overall improvement for the countries involved, because otherwise they&#x27;d be pulling out of it, right?",
