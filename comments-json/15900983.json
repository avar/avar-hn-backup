  "text" : "People including yourself have been missing the point with Nintendo&#x27;s raw performance for decades now. The Xbox, Playstation and Switch are all using off-the-shelf components, the days of console companies developing custom hardware really ended in the 90s, at best the early 2000s (PS3).<p>This means that today the fact that Nintendo has a slower console is <i>purely</i> a pricing and strategic decision, not some lack of ability to execute. Nintendo <i>knows</i> that when they release a console they might get some AAA games released on it in the first couple of years, but after that devs of AAA will leave it behind for more powerful consoles.<p>They&#x27;re fine with that, if you want AAA games you buy an Xbox or a PlayStation. Nintendo&#x27;s comfortable in their market segment. They&#x27;re willing to ignore the AAA market to bring their costs down.<p>There&#x27;s a name for the 3rd console that tried to compete on performance with the big boys, the Dreamcast.",
