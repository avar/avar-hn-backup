If people only had to pay with their own time they would, and the road would be congested, hence the high toll. This is basic supply &amp; demand.<p>You just keep asserting that people should pay for their pollution, I agree! But that&#x27;s not always the maximum price you should pay.<p><pre><code>    &gt; charge based on odometer readings.\n</code></pre>\nWhich would be another case of not charging based on the actual cost. You could drive your street legal car around in circles on a private track, and you should pay almost no road tax, but someone who exclusively uses public roads should pay more. Under this scheme you&#x27;d pay the same for both cars.",
