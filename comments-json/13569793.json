  "text" : "I&#x27;m completely unfamiliar with the Canadian real estate market, but where I live your ability to get a loan depends on your income and ability to pay the loan.<p>Given that, why does it matter if someone in Canada had a $200K home and the market dropped 30%, v.s. someone who had a $2M home and the market dropped 30%? Surely their earnings were priced into the loan?<p>Or is the Canadian real estate&#x2F;loan market so insane that nobody asks you if you can plausibly pay for the loan you&#x27;re taking?",
