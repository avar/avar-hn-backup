  "text" : "An interesting detail left out of the article is that Norway&#x27;s neighbor Iceland ended up signing a free-trade agreement with China in 2013, both Norway and Iceland had negotiations underway in 2010 when China broke ties with Norway.<p>Norway and Iceland are both EEA members, effectively with one foot in the EU, Iceland was the first European country to sign such an agreement with China.<p>Norway and Iceland having free-trade with China while having deep access to the European single market leaves EU expansion in an odd situation. Neither country could become a full EU member without hurting trade with China, or alternatively the EU would have to make a similar FTA with China beforehand.<p>I&#x27;ve wondered what the realpolitik of the situation is. Is China&#x27;s main interest in these deals to drive a wedge into further EU integration? Are they trying to create a situation where Norway and Iceland joining the EU would be contingent on the EU accepting a FTA with China?",
