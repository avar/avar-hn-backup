Yes humans are the measurement device, and humans differ and are unreliable, but given a sufficient number of samples you arrive at more accurate numbers.<p>Nobody&#x27;s going to give a paprika the same rating as a Carolina Reaper. You might have some give two very strong peppers the same rating, but then you might just need more people to test it.<p>In any case, the practical utility of the scale is mostly to get an idea of how spicy something is, it doesn&#x27;t really matter much if something is 700K or 600K, it&#x27;s enough to know that it&#x27;s around 2x as strong as a Habanero.",
