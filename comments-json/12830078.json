  "text" : "Yeah it&#x27;s going to be really interesting whatever happens.<p>As a point of clarification. The Independence Party and Progressive Party would be happy to form a government with each other, they think that overall they did great, and downplay the corruption that brought down the government.<p>But they don&#x27;t have enough following to do it on their own, and all the other parties they could form with have made commitments of not forming with those two together.<p>Although both were deeply involved in the corruption that brought down the government, the PM was from the Progressives, and it lost a massive following in the election while the Independence party gained following. So it&#x27;s politically untenable to work with the Progressives, but some parties might be willing to work with the Independence party.<p><pre><code>    &gt; Ind(21) + Reg(7) + Bri(4) = 32\n</code></pre>\nThis would be possible, and Bright Future isn&#x27;t ruling it out: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stundin.is&#x2F;frett&#x2F;bjort-framtid-utilokar-ekki-haegri-stjorn&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stundin.is&#x2F;frett&#x2F;bjort-framtid-utilokar-ekki-haegri-s...</a><p>But a one party majority in parliament would be really precarious, and it would be very interesting to see what concessions have to get made.<p><pre><code>    &gt; Lef(10) + Pir(10) + Reg(7) + Bri(4) + Soc(3) = 34\n</code></pre>\nThis would also be a really interesting combination. The Regeneration party says they don&#x27;t want to go into government with the Pirates, but who knows how much of this is political posturing. I don&#x27;t think they have any inherent clash of political issues they couldn&#x27;t both get over given some negotiation.",
