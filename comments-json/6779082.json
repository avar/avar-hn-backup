  "text" : "Using &quot;DMZ&quot; in this context is very confusing, in common usage it means the exact opposite of what you intended.<p>A lot of home routers have a &quot;DMZ&quot; feature that gives the device you put in the DMZ full access to the outside internet, but restricts their access to other hosts on the local network.<p>It&#x27;s typically used for gaming machines when you can&#x27;t be bothered to forward a lot of ports individually, I have a gaming console in a &quot;DMZ&quot; on my network so I can play games online without fuss.",
