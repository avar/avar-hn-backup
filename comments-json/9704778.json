  "text" : "By all accounts GTA V on PC is a massive hit, so they do seem to be &quot;pulling this&quot; on PC users too, and PC users are happily paying for it.<p>I also think the price is ridiculous, but it&#x27;s ridiculously cheap. You play most of these games for 40-60 hours, that&#x27;s approaching $1 per hour of entertainment. Almost nothing except books approach that, and those are usually written by 1-3 people at most, AAA games take orders of magnitude more people than that working on them over a period of years.<p>I think $60 is a steal for a good well-produced game compared to other forms of entertainment with which they&#x27;re competing, and clearly the market agrees since consumers are buying them in droves.",
