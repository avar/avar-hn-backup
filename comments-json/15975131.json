Downvoting is not a &quot;I disagree&quot; button like on Reddit, it&#x27;s a\n&quot;this is not interesting to discuss&quot; button, the fact that you&#x27;re\nreplying at all shows that it&#x27;s not the latter.<p><pre><code>    &gt; Do you think purchasing a few newspapers from[...]\n</code></pre>\nNo it&#x27;s certainly not the same, but it is interesting to think about\nhow established precedence for the discretion of advertisers, given\ntheir limited money resources and the fact that they have to pick\n<i>some</i> audience will be applied to social media.<p><pre><code>    &gt; How many accounts do I need: one white, one black, one\n    &gt; hispanic, one 20 - 30, one 30 - 40?? where does it end?\n</code></pre>\nHow many newspaper subscriptions do you need? What do those cost? I&#x27;m\njust pointing out that there&#x27;s always been a pay-to-play element to\njob seeking. In some sense what FB is enabling is shitty, but on the\nother hand the fee to play has never been lower.<p><pre><code>    &gt; It&#x27;s unethical developers like you that allows this\n    &gt; kind of thing to happen.\n</code></pre>\nI have zero relation to Facebook, and for what it&#x27;s worth I wish it\ndidn&#x27;t exist, but if it didn&#x27;t the next FB clone would just replace\nit.",
