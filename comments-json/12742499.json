  "text" : "Let&#x27;s say there was a country where 0.5% of the drivers used seat belts[1], and out of those mostly just race car drivers. Yet that country had no notable increase in injuries or fatalities in car crashes as a result compared to countries where seat belts were mandatory.<p>Add into that that in this parallel universe driving a car daily had big long-term health benefits, and the introduction of seat belt laws in other countries had caused driving to drop by 1&#x2F;3 [2], causing fewer people to cycle, overall health to decline, and a reduction in car safety due to less car safety in numbers. Since a major cause of accidents was that few people used cars daily, leading to accidents where people weren&#x27;t expecting them.<p>Then yeah, I think it would be completely fair to question whether wearing a seat belt in your car was worthwhile. But of course none of this analogy makes sense, which makes your argument rather nonsensical.<p>1. <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cyclehelmets.org&#x2F;1261.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cyclehelmets.org&#x2F;1261.html</a><p>2. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bicycle_helmet_laws#Effects_on_the_amount_of_cycling\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bicycle_helmet_laws#Effects_on...</a>",
