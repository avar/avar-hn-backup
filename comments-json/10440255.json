  "text" : "Good analysis, for those who have a knee-jerk reaction to this line of thinking, consider how you&#x27;d feel if we were talking about terrorist groups that we knew were planning massive strikes against civilization.<p>If you view deaths due to diseases that would be prevented by vaccination in that light the money that we&#x27;re spending on fighting terrorism versus spending similar amounts (literally trillions of dollars) on eradicating diseases by any means necessary (yes, even boots on the ground &amp; forceful vaccination) the situation starts looking very different.<p>Why can a few ignorant pockets of humanity hold the entirety of the rest of the species hostage in perpetuity? And unlike some needing to take out some insurgent group because they might attack the west it&#x27;s pretty much guaranteed that these diseases will flare up again, with guaranteed deaths for untold amount of innocents. Just look at how close we came with the recent Ebola crisis.",
