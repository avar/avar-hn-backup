There&#x27;s a 500 page PDF[1] exhaustively detailing every product category and what tolls &amp; fixed fees you pay on certain products. Ketchup 0% toll, Mayo 0% but 19 ISK per kg etc. Turn to page 50 and you can see different tolls &amp; fees for different types of cabbage.<p>It&#x27;s an entirely byzantine system, but because it&#x27;s happening when products are imported, or at the point of sale, it&#x27;s vastly easier for consumers than an equivalent system that works through tax rebates.<p>Things on that list occasionally become a political issue. E.g. the tax on added sugar has gone back &amp; forth a couple of times depending on who&#x27;s in government.<p>Still, this adds zero complexity to your tax return, or to the average person&#x27;s interaction with the government or private businesses.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tollur.is&#x2F;library&#x2F;Skrar&#x2F;Tollskra&#x2F;Tollskr%C3%A1%202017%20-%201.%20%C3%BAtg%C3%A1fa.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tollur.is&#x2F;library&#x2F;Skrar&#x2F;Tollskra&#x2F;Tollskr%C3%A1%2...</a>",
