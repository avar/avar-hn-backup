  "text" : "It&#x27;s advertised as a comedy show and with Seth MacFarlane (of Family Guy) headlining it I also assumed it was some cheap Galaxy Quest-esque jab at Star Trek. There&#x27;s some of that, in particular taking some jabs at Star Trek tropes (e.g. one situation being neatly resolved by the crew using seatbelts)[1].<p>But it&#x27;s not just some cheap comedy. Yes there&#x27;s campy humor that&#x27;s basically the equivalent of TOS not taking itself quite seriously, but it&#x27;s in every other way a proper modern day sequel to TNG, and the humor doesn&#x27;t get in the way of that.<p>I&#x27;m not going to spoil the 3rd episode of it that just came out, but it&#x27;s a &quot;moral conundrum&quot; episode of the likes TNG was famous for, except it&#x27;s IMNSHO executed better than any such TNG episode. Those tended to get resolved with some Deus Ex Machina or something resembling a stereotypically happy American ending, but The Orville took the hard way out. I was very impressed.<p>1. For those unfamiliar with Star Trek: Approximately half of on-screen fatalities could be prevented by some combination of seatbelt usage, and the computer consoles not being powered by 100,000 volts of electricity with no fuses or circuit breakers[2].<p>2. The other half being prevented by not bringing no-name red shirts along on the away mission.",
