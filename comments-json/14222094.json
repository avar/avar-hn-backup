  "text" : "I use OfflineIMAP to fetch &amp; emacs&#x2F;mu+mu4e+exim to read+index&#x2F;search+send my E-Mail. It works, and overall I&#x27;m happy with it.<p>I used to use mbsync but when my employer migrated from Cyrus to Exchange IMAP I couldn&#x27;t get mbsync to work with it, but OfflineIMAP worked just fine.<p>Now they&#x27;ve migrated to GMail, which works fine with both, and even though OfflineIMAP is more flexible &amp; easier to customize I&#x27;ll probably switch back at some point.<p>OfflineIMAP regularly pegs my CPU at &gt;100% just downloading a few dozen E-Mails, whereas mbsync&#x27;s CPU usage never went above 2-3%. When my laptop fan starts spinning it&#x27;s usually  OfflineIMAP in the background.<p>So if you&#x27;re looking for an IMAP-&gt;Maildir retriever or backup solution consider trying out mbsync first.<p>It&#x27;s a PAIN to switch between these programs, or even using the same data when switching between different servers (e.g. Cyrus -&gt; Exchange). Inexplicably neither of them have some sort of reindexing mode where they can take an existing Maildir and reconstruct their local database from local&#x2F;remote Message-Id&#x27;s. They both use &amp; maintain an opaque local database. That&#x27;s why I haven&#x27;t simply gone back to mbsync.",
