One thing it&#x27;s highly correlated with is whether you&#x27;re either a heterosexual woman, or a homosexual man.<p>There&#x27;s a really good description of this and other brain attributes correlated with gender or male homosexuality in the BBC show &quot;The Making of Me - John Barrowman&quot;.

There&#x27;s of course plenty of people who don&#x27;t fall into those groups who prefer to read maps that way, just to answer your question about whether there&#x27;s research about it. Yeah, there&#x27;s at least some research showing that spatial recognition is indicative of gender &amp; sexual orientation.",
