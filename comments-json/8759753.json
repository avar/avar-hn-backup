The search is entirely illegal but you go to jail anyway, after all they found some evidence. If they didn&#x27;t find some evidence that&#x27;s just a fine paid out of taxpayer money (police are similarly unaccountable almost everywhere).<p>By having the fruit of the poisoned tree doctrine police have a direct incentive to follow due process to the letter, least they get evidence or their entire case thrown out of court.<p>As other commenters here point out this doesn&#x27;t always work out well in the US, but at least it&#x27;s better than nothing.",
