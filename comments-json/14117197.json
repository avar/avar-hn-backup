Those places aren&#x27;t death traps.<p>Ditto mountaineering tours etc. for newbies that usually have every incentive not to report if they damage some of the equipment.<p>Carabiners, ropes &amp; the like are tested when they&#x27;re manufactured. Any damage likely to damage their structural integrity is usually going to be quite obvious. E.g. the carabiner won&#x27;t close, or the rope will look like shit (although puncturing the core of a rope with crampons can be a subtle exception).<p>All other things being equal you&#x27;re likely to be better off with brand new equipment, but you&#x27;re also probably way better with used equipment where you spent that extra $500 you saved on some safety course &amp; expert instruction, than skipping that and buying a brand new rope &amp; carabiners.<p>Failing to properly secure a knot to a used carabiner is a <i>way</i> more likely cause of death than the carabiner itself failing.",
