  "text" : "It's unclear from this whether or not Python would have to change the name of the programming language if they didn't get the trademark, or whether this UK company would just have the right to call their products \"Python\" too.<p>Early in the article it says: \"There is a company in the UK that is trying to trademark the use of the term \"Python\" for all software, services, servers... pretty much anything having to do with a computer.\".<p>And later it says, where the Python foundation is soliciting comments: \"your view that another company using term Python to refer to services, software, and servers would be confusing\".<p>I for one hope the Python foundation <i>doesn't</i> get an exclusive trademark for all \"software, services, servers\" in the E.U. Outside of software \"Python\" is a well-known generic name for an animal, I don't think the EU should be protecting such generic names.<p>But on the other hand it would also suck if this U.K. company gained exclusive use over the trademark.",
