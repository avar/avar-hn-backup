  "text" : "Fuel taxes are a very crude tool, road tolls are much better instrument to actually regulate the behavior you care about.<p>If you raise fuel taxes because there&#x27;s too much congestion that&#x27;s going to equally affect someone who lives in some rural area where congestion isn&#x27;t an issue at all, and someone who&#x27;s driving down a busy freeway every day contributing to congestion.<p>You also raise the price of gasoline, which has other uses that have nothing whatsoever to do with road transport.<p>If you want to discourage specific behavior you should tax that specific behavior, not tax something one or two steps removed from the behavior you care about.",
