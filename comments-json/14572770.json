  "text" : "I&#x27;m pointing out the casual fallacy and blatant disregard for foreigners in the GPs comments &quot;leave behind a sick employee pool&quot;, as if though moving an obviously dangerous job from their own country (with stricter safety regulations) to another country will just magically fix the problem, as opposed to just making people in some other country sick instead.<p>Assuming a world where every country had the same workplace safety regulations, it seems obvious that a richer more developed country would be better prepared to deal with workplace injuries and other ailments that result having less strict regulation.<p>Which is why I&#x27;m critiquing the GPs comment as having more to do with &quot;nationalism than concern for overall human safety&quot;. We should be concerned with the overall human cost of the products we use, not whether the people injured in their production happen to live in place A or place B.<p>Some of the EU laws you mention are certainly a step in the right direction, but they&#x27;re only skin deep. No penalties are paid for outsourcing toxicity to poorer countries during the normal import of consumer products, just for some exports of toxic material. The former category is much larger than the latter.",
