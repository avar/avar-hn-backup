You could dismiss pretty much any election by multiplying the &quot;yes&quot; votes with voter turnout to get less than 50%.<p>That&#x27;s just how democracies work, if you don&#x27;t care enough to vote you don&#x27;t get a say, that doesn&#x27;t mean the opinions of people who do turn up should be given less weight.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;United_Kingdom_European_Communities_membership_referendum,_1975\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;United_Kingdom_European_Commun...</a>",
