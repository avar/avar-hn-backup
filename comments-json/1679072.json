And since they don't care they don't have the legal framework in place anymore to do copyright assignments.<p>The FSF could have these changes if they wanted if they didn't require copyright assignment.<p>Personally I don't contribute to FSF projects because copyright assignments are a PITA. I can see how a company that doesn't <i>need</i> to contribute to GCC anymore just doesn't care enough to initiate the requisite legal work.",
