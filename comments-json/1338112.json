It doesn't mean that you can't set up a router or another piece of Internet infrastructure without using Perl.<p>It means that Perl is used in a lot of unexpected places, and that a lot of critical things are \"held together\" by Perl. Even if you think your website is running on Java, some systems administrator probably has a cronjob written in Perl critical to its operation.",
