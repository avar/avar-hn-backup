  "text" : "Nobody thinks airplanes are indestructible, but it is counteractive to those not familiar with commercial aviation that not only is the market for licensing new airframes regulated, but that older airframes are expected to be retrofitted to the latest safety standards or lose their license.<p>This isn&#x27;t how e.g. trains, buses and even taxis are regulated. E.g. I believe in most of the western world you could still operate an antique car without seat belts as a taxi.<p>This is how I read the GPs comment of &quot;I take it 747s have been safe up til now&quot;. The only way the bus&#x2F;train&#x2F;taxi in my example would lose its license is if it could be shown if the vehicle didn&#x27;t adhere to the safety standards <i>at the time</i>, whereas the same isn&#x27;t true for airplanes at all due to how the FAA &amp; EASA regulate them.",
