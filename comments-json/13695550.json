My reading of the quote I referenced &quot;I would never act contrary...&quot; is that she&#x27;s choosing not to act contrary to the visions she sees.<p>But it could indeed be that the Heptapod language is some sort of brain virus and any information she gets from the future she&#x27;s helpless carrying out like some automaton. See the sibling thread about a &quot;memetic virus&quot;.<p>In any case, what I&#x27;m pointing out in this thread is that I think at there&#x27;s no way to make sense of the storyline of the movie, since it&#x27;s internally self-contradictory in how it treats time travel.<p>I don&#x27;t have time to dig this up now, but there were some interviews after it came out where it was made clear that this change was purely made to make the movie more appealing to viewers, at the cost of internal consistency.",
