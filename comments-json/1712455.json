Perl is a more mature platform than Python, and backwards compatibility is taken more seriously. The latest Perl 5.12 release can still run most of the test suite for Perl 1 released back in 1987.<p>That and its wide availability and portability make it a much better target than Python for something like glue in a build system for a project that's mostly in C anyway.<p>But even though it's backwards compatible with old code it's still somewhat of a pain to write code that works on old releases that don't have the modules / core features you want.<p>Backwards compatibility also comes at a price. Many of the changes that broke old Python code broke it because old warts were being fixed in Python. There's a lot of equivalent old warts in Perl that haven't been fixed, and there's no plan for doing so (other than Perl 6).",
