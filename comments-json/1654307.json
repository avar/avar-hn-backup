  "text" : "Mars is very cold right now with almost no atmosphere, and it has remained relatively unchanged for billions (yes, billions) of years.<p>Terraforming it would entail thickening the atmosphere and heating it up. That'd cause a lot of changes to its surface. Water frozen for eons might start flowing, gases currently frozen in the ground might start evaporating etc.<p>Eventually it might start raining, which would start massive planet-wide erosion. There's a reason you see craters on the Moon and not on Earth: It rains.",
