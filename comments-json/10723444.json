It&#x27;s because the\ninfidels are on their homeland, not because they&#x27;re using some\nspecific technology to attack them.<p>More generally people resort to terrorism in the face of an\noverwhelming enemy. The west could relatively easily win the wars\nthey&#x27;re fighting now in the middle-east with their WWI armies if they\nwere willing to care less about civilian casualties, that&#x27;s how\nlopsided the odds are.<p><pre><code>    &gt; Thinking we can wage wars without risk to ourselves or our\n    &gt; &quot;soldiers&quot; is preposterous.\n</code></pre>\nDrones as a technology would happen regardless of whether or not the\narmies developing them were concerned about their own\nsoldiers. They&#x27;re simply the logical next step in technology,\ne.g. fighter jet development has stalled to some extent not because\nthe technology has reached its limits, but because if you pull more\nG&#x27;s than you do now the pilots might die.",
