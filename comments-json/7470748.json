  "text" : "Maybe you&#x27;re looking for something more than a gift, but are you actually entitled to more than that? Are you a shareholder in these companies than you fund through Kickstarter? I think not.<p>So why do you think you have any rights beyond someone who&#x27;s donating money to a cause that may never pan out?<p>It&#x27;s perfectly fine to fund something through Kickstarter, but for some reason it seems that some people doing it think they&#x27;re entering into a deal that isn&#x27;t really there.<p>Generally when you give money through Kickstarter you&#x27;re <i>giving it away</i> without any string attached, only if the company pans out might you actually get some small gift, not a share of the profit.<p>What&#x27;s so hard to understand about that? The model&#x27;s fine. The problem is that for some reason people donating to it think of themselves as shareholders, not donors.",
