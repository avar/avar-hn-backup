In my experience this is way more pronounced with the US than any other country that&#x27;s discussed on HN.<p>Of course any country that&#x27;s discussed here is likely to attract people from that country who feel they have something to explain or defend, but due to the userbase being predominantly American the bias is very much towards the US, not India, Russia, China or whatever.",
