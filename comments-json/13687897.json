  "text" : "I live in Amsterdam and mostly bike around, but sometimes you need to get a car for whatever reason.<p>Uber&#x27;s much cheaper. I&#x27;ve had a car from the airport into the city go as low as 17 EUR, usually around 25. Hailing a taxi costs at least 40 EUR.<p>It&#x27;s also very convenient to know the location of your arriving taxi for knowing when to leave a party and leaving out several minutes of explaining the route to the driver.<p>It&#x27;s also not uncommon for taxi drivers here to drive you a much longer route if they think you&#x27;re not a local and don&#x27;t know where they&#x27;re going. It&#x27;s happened to me, and several of my friends. Never happened with Uber.<p>I&#x27;ve also found service with Uber to be much better. The first time I tried it here in Amsterdam the driver offered me a bottle of water and asked how I was doing. That had never happened to me once here in Amsterdam. The customer ability to rate drivers does wonders for service over traditional taxi companies.",
