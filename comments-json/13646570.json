During the winter they&#x27;re inside a barn because everything is covered in snow, during the entirety of the summer they free range getting fatter, raising lambs etc. In the autumn there&#x27;s a big coordinated herding event (g√∂ngur) where farmers and volunteers in an entire area coordinate to herd all the free-range sheep into pens for the winter.<p>So literally nobody in the country works as a full-time sheepherder. Since it&#x27;s all over in a matter of days.",
