  "text" : "I interpreted your comment as saying that hot water was piped directly into homes from a natural source, but I see now that you may not have meant that.<p>There are exceptions, but generally hot water is piped directly into homes in Iceland from municipal heating. There&#x27;s no domestic water heaters. There are dual hot &amp; cold water pipes everywhere. The hot water that comes out of the tap is from the same source that&#x27;s in the hot water radiators.<p>In the case of Reykjav√≠k the hot water is initially cold water heated at Nesjavellir[1] and at [2] you can see an article in Icelandic about the pipe. It&#x27;s 27km of 80x90cm pipe that can transfer 1600 liters of 100 degree hot water per second. Here&#x27;s the pipe on Street View: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;jFzvYN\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;jFzvYN</a><p>The reason they heat up cold water is simply because most of the time when you find an abundant natural heat source it doesn&#x27;t also come with an abundant natural water source. Therefore you pump cold water in, mix it with the heat, and pump out hot water.<p>I don&#x27;t know what fancy technology they use for this at Nesjavellir, but in some rural areas this setup is literally just a coiled pipe dropped into a hot spring.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nesjavellir_Geothermal_Power_Station\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nesjavellir_Geothermal_Power_S...</a><p>2. <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.verkis.is&#x2F;verkefni&#x2F;veitur&#x2F;vatnsveitur&#x2F;nesjavallaraed\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.verkis.is&#x2F;verkefni&#x2F;veitur&#x2F;vatnsveitur&#x2F;nesjavallar...</a>",
