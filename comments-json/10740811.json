  "text" : "The issue under discussion in this lawsuit is that the subject of the article is claiming that her birthyear is private information, but the Wikipedia article&#x27;s source for the birthyear is a book that she herself published[1].<p>I think some things are being lost in translation in this article, but generally speaking in many European privacy laws you can argue that something that&#x27;s private information is in the public interest, or you can argue that it&#x27;s not really private, either because the subject is a public person, or that it&#x27;s a generally well-known fact.<p>I think it&#x27;s really a stretch to maintain that your birthyear is private information if you&#x27;re a screenwriter&#x2F;director who has a self-authored book saying what year you were born in. Your birthyear is public information at that point by any reasonable definition.<p>1. <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Tradition-lyrischen-Hofmannsthal-university-literature&#x2F;dp&#x2F;382040144X\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Tradition-lyrischen-Hofmannsthal-unive...</a>",
