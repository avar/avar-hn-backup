  "text" : "Leaving the hairy question of immigration aside, you&#x27;re assuming that economic systems on the scale of nation-states are zero-sum. It&#x27;s not at all clear that providing a service to one person v.s. a million people is &quot;cheaper&quot; on that scale, because when you&#x27;re talking about a nation you <i>also</i> tax those million people.<p>You can take this logic to its extremes and assume that if you had only one very wealthy person living in the US that providing services for that one person would be cheaper. That wouldn&#x27;t be the case.<p>Then how about if there&#x27;s 100 million people? 300? 600? Generally speaking having more people should increase the economic efficiency. If you have a tax base of 600 million people that&#x27;s going to give you more resources to save your piggly-wiggly turtles than if you had 100 or 300.",
