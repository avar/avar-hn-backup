So if you&#x27;re an environmentally conscious UK consumer you should be spending extra to buy NZ beef instead of buying locally produced beef.<p>This is because the carbon impact of the transportation generally hovers around 10%, which leaves the other 90% for actually producing the product &quot;locally&quot;, and some locations on earth are vastly more efficient by every environmental metric in growing certain crops or raising certain livestock.<p>From the podcast: &quot;An acre of land in Idaho can produce twice the amount of potatoes as an acre of land in Kansas&quot;.<p>Which leaves two reasons to buy locally.<p>Firstly you may be living in one of the places that&#x27;s efficient at producing a given product, e.g. you&#x27;d buy local beef in New Zealand instead of importing it from the UK.<p>Secondly there are certain products that don&#x27;t ship well, e.g. heirloom tomatoes. There you simply don&#x27;t have the option of buying anything except local varieties.<p>1. <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theskepticsguide.org&#x2F;podcast&#x2F;sgu&#x2F;514\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theskepticsguide.org&#x2F;podcast&#x2F;sgu&#x2F;514</a>",
