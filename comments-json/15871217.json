  "text" : "Discouraging driving in general is one thing with one market price, discouraging driving where it leads to congestion is another thing with a higher market price.<p>Not all vehicles that cause congestion even use gasoline, which is another reason for why trying to solve congestion with higher fuel taxes is a bad idea. Your Tesla is just as bad for congestion as a gas guzzler.<p>Even ignoring that, regional fuel charges don&#x27;t fix the problem. There&#x27;s plenty of big cities where you can drive in specific areas or at specific times without causing any congestion problems, which is why it makes sense to charge road tolls on specific roads at specific times.<p>Vehicles can also drive to different regions to fill up, which becomes a big problem of arbitrage if you try to make the regions too granular.",
