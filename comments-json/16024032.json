  "text" : "A much more cost-effective way of dealing with radiation on Mars is to construct shelters out of something that doesn&#x27;t shield against radiation at all, then only pick astronauts who are smokers, and send them to Mars without cigarettes[1].<p>For the smokers sent to Mars living in flimsy shelters this&#x27;ll decrease their lifetime odds of dying from cancer compared to smoking two packs a day and staying on Earth.<p>This article like so many others describes designs for Mars habitats that are optimized for being accepted under NASA&#x27;s strict safety rules, and it&#x27;s an organization run by safety-obsessed bureaucrats.<p>I predict that once the second space race kicks off in earnest these unpractical restrictions are going to be quickly dismissed, because NASA&#x27;s going to have to compete with e.g. China which&#x27;ll likely use much simpler designs because they&#x27;re realistic about their risk assessments.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.space.com&#x2F;21813-mars-one-colony-space-radiation.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.space.com&#x2F;21813-mars-one-colony-space-radiation....</a>",
