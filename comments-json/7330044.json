I mainly replied to give some (admittedly amateur) general advice on seeking asylum v.s. pursuing a work visa.<p>Since he did ask what projects we have at the company that I happen to work at I thought it was simpler just to mention where I work.<p>We have a lot of promotion &amp; hiring material online, and it&#x27;s way easier just to mention where I work and have the OP check that out than for me to write up some some long-winded description of what the company does, all the while trying not to mention what company I&#x27;m talking about.<p>It&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s that many companies in Amsterdam that run online hotel booking websites. So any interested reader could infer what company I was talking about anyway if I were to describe what sort of projects we work on.",
