  "text" : "I wasn&#x27;t making any argument for why English <i>should</i> be the lingua franca. In any case all such arguments are academic, it&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s going to be some meeting where the lingua franca gets decided.<p>Let&#x27;s say that there was such a meeting and &quot;we&quot; all decided that we&#x27;re going to speak Klingon or whatever as a lingua franca. How do you think that would work? People wouldn&#x27;t care what the decreed language is, maybe you&#x27;d have UN meetings in it, pass laws to teach it in school in lots of nations or something.<p>It would probably become even more of an elitist skill than just using a language that already has lots of native and non-native speakers already and lots of culture to go along with it, just like Latin was back when we effectively had this sort of arrangement, sans the constructed language.<p>Finally, if you really haven&#x27;t heard a better reason for why English became the current dominant language than &quot;it&#x27;s already spoken by X people, but how come not Chinese and Spanish&quot; you really owe it to yourself to read some of the things that come up when you Google the likes of &quot;history of lingua franca&quot; etc.",
