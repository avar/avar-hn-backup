But I've always found it annoying.<p>&#62; In practice this works fine, and it's not even algorithmically different, since a hash access is a constant time operation.<p>It is actually. Read the array.c and zend_hash.c code. It's only a constant time operation if you're not interested in the difference between whether a hash key actually exists, or whether it exists and its value is set to NULL. The former is O(n) if you use array_key_exists. From zend_hash_exists:<p><pre><code>    while (p != NULL) {\n        if ((p-&#62;h == h) &#38;&#38; (p-&#62;nKeyLength == nKeyLength)) {\n            if (!memcmp(p-&#62;arKey, arKey, nKeyLength)) {\n                return 1;\n            }\n        }\n        p = p-&#62;pNext;\n    }\n    return 0;\n</code></pre>\n&#62;&#62; PHP doesn't have multiple inheritance, fine, but it doesn't have mixins/modules, either.<p>&#62; We do not want! Locality of code is worth more to us<p>Code that I'd write in Common Lisp or Perl that takes advantage of multiple inheritance and the composition it offers is a lot uglier in PHP when I have to hack around not having multiple inheritance. It leads to bigger and monolithic classes that you can't easily compose.<p>&#62;&#62; Because it is designed to be run in the context of Apache, PHP doesn't work very well as a command-line scripting language,<p>&#62; A hammer doesn't drive screws very well<p>This is actually a major problem with PHP. Unlike Perl, Python, Ruby, Lisp etc. you can't easily run most PHP code persistently, so the execution model for most applications is to parse, compile and execute the application for each request.<p>You can get around that in some cases, but some core language features have been blocking this until relatively recently. E.g. create_function() would always leak memory, but in 5.3 PHP finally has support for anonymous functions.",
