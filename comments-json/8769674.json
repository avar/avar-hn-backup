  "text" : "Nobody&#x27;s disputing that, but the Japanese custom for adult adoption is something else entirely: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_adult_adoption\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Japanese_adult_adoption</a><p>So if you adopt a child and raise it as your own and that child takes over your business, is it still a &quot;family business? Yes.<p>But can you say it&#x27;s still a &quot;family&quot; business if it&#x27;s gone through the Japanese custom of adult adoption? Arguably yes, because that person was brought into their family as a legitimate heir.<p>On the other hand you could argue that it&#x27;s no different than a family business being sold in the western sense, it&#x27;s just that in ancient Japan you couldn&#x27;t really buy and sell businesses, they were owned by clans, so this was their mechanism for ensuring business continuity when there was no suitable male heir.<p>I&#x27;m not taking a stance on whether it&#x27;s still a &quot;real&quot; family business, but it&#x27;s important to understand that what the Japanese mean by &quot;adoption&quot; in this sense is not at all what westerners mean when they use that word.",
