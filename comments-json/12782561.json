I know it&#x27;s not water soluble, but it has the effect of evenly distributing the burn around my mouth, which feels better to me.<p>For some reason I&#x27;m a lot more bothered by extremely localized pain than evenly distributed pain, when you chew a pepper you tend to e.g. disproportionately burn on one side of your tongue. Drinking some water and swishing it around in your mouth solves that problem.",
