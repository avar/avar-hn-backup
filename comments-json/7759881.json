Him and his wife traveled to Austria in the 80s and were having trouble checking into a room in some rural town because it didn&#x27;t seem as though they were married.<p>He was able to find an encyclopedia on a bookshelf in the lobby that said something to the effect of &quot;In Iceland women do not take their husband&#x27;s name when they marry&quot;.
