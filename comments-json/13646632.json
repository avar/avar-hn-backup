  "text" : "Disclaimer: Am Icelandic, very generally proud of how my country punches above its weight in sports.<p>Having said that it&#x27;s unbelievable how a publication like The Guardian can write an article about UEFA 2016 with claims like &quot;smallest nation ever to reach a major tournament&quot;, without mentioning that 2016 is the first year where 24 teams compete, instead of 16 as has been the case since 1996. Before that it was 8 for a while, and 4 when the tournament first started in the 60s.<p>Iceland&#x27;s been getting consistently better at football for decades now, and it beat England last year in the tournament showing that it could play with the big boys. But <i>obviously</i> if the tournament is expanded from 16 to 24 teams, an increase of 50%, it&#x27;s going to be the first year that some small team qualifies.",
