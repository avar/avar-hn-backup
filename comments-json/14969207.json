  "text" : "Worrying about the water &amp; coast is a very real concern in The Netherlands. I didn&#x27;t mean to give the opposite impression.<p>The intent of my comment is to explain that the mental image many have of The Netherlands (even some natives are guilty of this) that it&#x27;s all effectively under sealevel held up by some above-sealevel walls facing the ocean is false.<p>Most big population centers are above sealevel, those that aren&#x27;t are usually &quot;landlocked&quot; below-sealevel areas, i.e. surrounded by land that&#x27;s not below sealevel.<p>Flooding&#x27;s still a major concern, but it&#x27;s as much about ensuring that these landlocked areas don&#x27;t turn into big puddles whenever it rains as it is about holding storm surges from the ocean back.<p>This is why the top comment in this thread stating that &quot;we are ALREADY beneath sea level!&quot; is BS. The nominal state of The Netherlands is not to be under sea level, but just barely above it.<p>This means that it&#x27;s vulnerable to heavy rains, storm surges etc. But it also means that it&#x27;s no more prepared than most other countries if the ocean were to rapidly rise and start overflowing &amp; eroding the above-sealevel costal areas that protect the under-sealevel inland areas from being permanently flooded.",
