E.g.:<p>* Does it actually matter that the absolute value of temperature sensors is inaccurate, or is it enough that they have good relative accuracy (do they?)<p>* Do you really need to tell if someone is indoors or outdoors given a large enough sample of users in a given area? That also seems like something you could detect with heuristics (work hours, jumps up&#x2F;down in temperature).<p>There&#x27;s a lot of ways to tease useful signals from noisy data. Is it really the case that smart phone temperature sensors in the aggregate are useless as an input into weather forecasting models?",
