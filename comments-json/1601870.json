  "text" : "Well, firstly this isn't a big problem for HTTP based services like justin.tv, almost all Tor exit nodes allow HTTP exits, but it's a bigger issue for non-HTTP exits.<p>But the better way is to take into account exit policies. Only ban access from those IPs that are Tor exits <i>and</i> allow access through to justin.tv.<p>You can query the exit policies of a given exit with TorDNSEL: <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/tordnsel/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.torproject.org/tordnsel/</a><p>I also whipped up a quick script that can be fed a list of Tor exit nodes on STDIN and will spew out a list of exits that aren't allowed to access a given IP:PORT: <a href=\"http://gist.github.com/523328\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://gist.github.com/523328</a><p>According to that 5/1338 Tor exits have policies that don't allow exits to justin.tv on port 80 (199.9.249.22:80), but e.g. 309/1338 ban exits to irc.freenode.org:6667.<p>That means that justin.tv is needlessly banning ~0.4% of Tor exit nodes, but someone using the same approach with an IRC server is needlessly banning ~23%. With SMTP (checked on a random GMail server) that percentage rises to 98.8%.",
