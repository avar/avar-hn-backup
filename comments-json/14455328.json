  "text" : "A fair comparison is not what SpaceX is doing today, but what SpaceX could be doing with today&#x27;s technology with multi-percentage points of US GDP as their funding.<p>In that context it&#x27;s not at all impressive that they&#x27;re just getting past beating 60s technology, and not even in all cases. Yes they&#x27;ve got reusability, but there&#x27;s still nothing as big as the Saturn V.<p>Edit: To clarify, I think SpaceX is very impressive, but I think we as a species are doing proportionally less impressive things than in the 20th century given the level of technology we have. It&#x27;s not their fault we aren&#x27;t spending multi-percentage points of GDP on similarly impressive projects.",
