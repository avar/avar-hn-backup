  "text" : "The article does have such a separation, but you navigated down to the section about the fifth season. Honestly, what were you expecting if not a summary of what happens is that season?<p>Also, who should spoiler warnings in an article about a TV series benefit? People who haven&#x27;t seen the latest series? People who haven&#x27;t seen it at all?<p>Should the summary say nothing about how Walt turns to crime (which wasn&#x27;t apparent to me when I started watching it), and instead describe Breaking Bad in vague terms as the struggles of a New Mexico man to provide for his family?<p>Spoiler warnings are inherently at odds with writing a succinct and accurate summary of a given subject, which is what Wikipedia strives to do.<p>Other commenters here are right, if you don&#x27;t want something spoiled for you then simply don&#x27;t read encyclopedia articles about it.<p>You wanted some information about the structure of the aired episodes, there&#x27;s plenty of TV-guide like sources for that that aren&#x27;t encyclopedias.",
