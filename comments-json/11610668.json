I went for the food, the onsen, the city life, nature etc. I wasn&#x27;t interested enough in their role in WWII to make the trip all the way down to the southern tip.<p>I think if I had 4 more weeks in Japan I probably still wouldn&#x27;t go. I&#x27;m much more interested in say exploring Hokkaido &amp; The Japanese Alps than going to war museums.",
