  "text" : "That&#x27;s very informative. Thanks, just to be clear I honestly meant my initial post as a question, not as a snarky rhetorical remark.<p>It&#x27;s really interesting to know about the history behind something like an obscure tax, and how something like the EP directive to tax carbon emissions gets implemented as adjusting an existing tax with its own historical baggage at a level where it&#x27;s exactly matching the revenue, but now ostensibly for a different purpose.<p>Unless the law changes though the tax will de-facto be phased out in the coming years&#x2F;decades as zero-carbon vehicles get adopted, I wonder if that&#x27;s something the people who made the change back in 2007&#x2F;2010 explicitly had in mind or if it&#x27;s an unintended emergent phenomena. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see if the tax is allowed to go away or if there&#x27;ll be another reform to tax luxury vehicles or something like that.",
