  "text" : "What exactly about this suggestion for colonizing Mars has been falling on \"deaf\" ears, who's been suggesting that we \"improve [the] environment by force\" on Mars?<p>The few plans I've seen involve trying to terraform Mars slowly by introducing something like genetically modified high-altitude lichen and going from there. Of course in the process of doing so we'd use the organisms that work, not \"force\" the things we wish would work.<p>The challenges of terraforming Mars will be very different than dropping a few trees on Ascension Island, which is what the Royal Navy did.<p>As an aside, I recommend the Mars Trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson for an overview of how Mars might be incrementally terraformed through that method.",
