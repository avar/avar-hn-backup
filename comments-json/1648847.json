  "text" : "It's very nice to see Facebook open up a lot of its infrastructure. They're doing a <i>lot</i> better in that area than Google, which usually doesn't do that.<p>However they still have a long way to go in embracing open development. Last I checked most of the projects on <a href=\"http://github.com/facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://github.com/facebook</a> (including HipHop) were still mostly regular code dumps, not something being developed on GitHub.<p>They still seem to mostly use internal source control and bug trackers. Which makes it much harder for others to contribute to their projects, and for them to get the full benefits of opening up.",
