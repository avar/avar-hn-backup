  "text" : "I reinstalled my laptop with btrfs on &#x2F; because &quot;why not&quot; about a year ago.<p>I ran into issues with maintaining a huge ~1M file Maildir, it seemed to do very badly with huge directories. Some kernel thread would be at 99% CPU while I was trying to populate a Maildir, and the entire system ground to a halt.<p>More importantly I would run into issues like running out of space on &#x2F; with 20G left, but it was the &quot;wrong kind of space&quot;. I.e. I had run out of metadata space but had plenty of file space left and had to run a rebalancing operation on the filesystem.<p>I didn&#x27;t need any of the COW etc. advanced features that btrfs provides, and didn&#x27;t test them, but as just a normal user needing a general purpose filesystem it was a bit too much hassle, especially with needing to administer the filesystem in a manner similar to how I might administer a RDBMS.<p>I ended up just going back to ext4.",
