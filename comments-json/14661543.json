Google is not a Canadian company, so the more accurate comparison would be the US trying to control who the Russian Kalashnikov Concern sells AK-47&#x27;s to, just because they&#x27;re also for sale in the US.<p><pre><code>    &gt; The nature of them being an international\n    &gt; corporation should not mean they are immune\n    &gt; to everyone&#x27;s laws.\n</code></pre>\nNobody&#x27;s advocating that the likes of Google should be immune to everyone&#x27;s laws, but rather that it&#x27;s overstepping that any given country is going beyond just instructing an international corporation on how to behave within <i>their</i> borders.<p><pre><code>    &gt; International corporations should be required\n    &gt; to follow all of them.\n</code></pre>\nSo if Saudia Arabia decides that showing any images of women more revealing than the niqab in Google Images that should be applied globally? This is just a recipe for a race to the bottom.",
