  "text" : "The USSR made some amazing contributions to technology, but it&#x27;s a bit of an exaggeration to say that it &quot;gave birth to human travel in space&quot; which to me implies that it was a novel technology nobody else was working on and wouldn&#x27;t have happened any time soon without them.<p>The first manned US flight was a month after the Soviet one, and the US had successfully returned monkeys from space before that, so arguably they were ahead technologically but less willing to use a human test subject.<p>It&#x27;s more accurate to say that ICBM development in both the US and USSR had the unintended side-effect of giving birth to human space travel once the political benefits of using nuclear launch systems for human space travel were realized.",
