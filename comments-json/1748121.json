  "text" : "We've been referring to different things. Since you referred to \"indefinite space travel\" I thought you were talking about not going to another solar system at all, i.e. that \"land\" meant orbiting another sun.<p>But that was obviously a misreading on my part. Anyway, I completely agree with you that once your ark ship arrives in a new solar system landing on a planet like Gliese 581g would be counterproductive.<p>Instead of having to deal with a gravity well it would be better to make a home in something like the asteroid belt. You only need energy &#38; resources for manufacturing capacity, a gravity well can only complicate that process.<p>People might still want to live on planets as a novelty, or for their resources. But I think any society sufficiently advanced to develop a generational ship that can traverse interstellar space would resemble The Culture (i.e. a swarm of migrating ships &#38; habitats) more than they would resemble The Federation (i.e. people mostly living on planets with ships mainly for transport).",
