  "text" : "The ISS is more Russian than it is western. The West has contributed more money to it, but Russia was an essential partner and contributed most of the core technology due to their experience with Mir.<p>Regardless of that, while RT has its biases, do you really think they extend to a mundane article about bacteria on Mir &amp; the ISS?
