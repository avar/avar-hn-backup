  "text" : "You can&#x27;t view community policy and government regulation as two unrelated things. The aviation community has a more welcoming attitude <i>because</i> of government regulation.<p>They know that someone&#x27;s backyard airplane isn&#x27;t ever going to be used commercially without certification, and even if it were the entire world&#x27;s aviation fleet isn&#x27;t going to start using that model overnight, as might happen with some homebrew crypto and a popular new app. So the situation is entirely unanalogous.",
