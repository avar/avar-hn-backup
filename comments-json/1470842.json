  "text" : "No, it isn't strange at all that placebos work if your definition of \"works\" just covers subjective experience. Comments like \"I have seen many infants and young kids get better immediately with the homeopathy use. I am not sure if the placebo effect can work on them.\" show that you aren't aware of observer bias, for one.<p>How do you explain that the supposed effects of homeopathy evaporate like the morning dew once they're placed in the setting of a double-blind scientific experiment with proper (well, in this case more) placebo controls?",
