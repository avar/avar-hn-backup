  "text" : "Here&#x27;s a thought experiment you can use to clarify the difference between good &amp; evil: What would each side in a conflict do if they had overwhelming power?<p>We have plenty of evidence to see what the US would do. When they defeated Germany &amp; Japan at the end of WWII did they enslave their people? Use their nuclear advantage to conquer new lands and colonize them? No, they rebuilt their economies and tried to ensure that they had stable governments &amp; trading partners.<p>What do you think ISIS would do with exclusive use of nuclear weapons? How about Iraq under Saddam etc? Do you think Hamas would be equally deterred by Israelis using their children as human shields as Israelis are by Hamas using theirs for that purpose?<p>Of course good &amp; evil isn&#x27;t black and white, the western world does a lot of bad stuff. But it&#x27;s just as brainwashed to think that just because all sides cause some civilian casualties to think that everyone&#x27;s morally equal, as it is to think that the US is some altruistic knight in shining armor that can do no wrong.",
