  "text" : "I quizzed my interviewers for about an hour on how Booking did things and why when I had my interview, and I still got hired. Besides, like everyone if we don&#x27;t hire someone we don&#x27;t tell them why due to liability reasons.<p>So if you had an interview and got rejected maybe it was for some completely different reason, I&#x27;ve certainly never heard about someone getting rejected because they asked too many questions.<p>You might get rejected because you don&#x27;t seem like a good fit though. I commented on this a bit more specifically in a Reddit discussion a while ago: <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/1mkdl4/what_exactly_is_up_with_bookingcom/ccaemqk\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;perl&#x2F;comments&#x2F;1mkdl4&#x2F;what_exactly_is...</a><p>Anyway, it&#x27;s unclear from your post whether you tried and failed at an interview with Booking, or whether you used to work there. If it&#x27;s the former I&#x27;d be happy to help you with another try.<p>Like any employer we&#x27;d rather not hire one right person than hire ten people we shouldn&#x27;t have hired, so statistically we reject some candidates that would have been good fits.",
