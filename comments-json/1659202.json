And what do you have to back up the assertion that \"natural selection does not work like that\", when all the evidence and consequently the consensus of the scientific community is that it does.<p>The idea you're advocating has a name, \"Irreducible complexity\"[1], and has been debunked time and time again as pseudoscience. I won't go into debunking specific assertions you made (such as the impossibility of the evolution of lungs), but I really encourage you to read the current literature of evolutionary theory. Once you see the mountain of evidence for it you'll probably be convinced.<p>1. <a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Irreducible_complexity\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Irreducible_c...</a>",
