You don&#x27;t get to not have acquired taste, everyone has it, it&#x27;s just a function of the food you keep eating, usually to do with where you&#x27;re from.<p>There&#x27;s a definite plus in acquiring certain tastes, because it&#x27;ll open up whole new worlds of food &amp; drink for you that you can&#x27;t believe you previously did without. Examples include: Spicy food, fermented food, dried beef&#x2F;fish&#x2F;whatever, heavily fried foods, sweet, savory, stinky cheeses etc. etc.<p>Some things you really can&#x27;t just try once. One good example is spicy food (containing capsaicin). Where I grew up there was none of that at all, but as an adult I made a concerted effort to try to wean myself on it because there had to be something to it if so many people were eating it. Today spiciness is one of my favorite food attributes.",
