The Wikipedia article on the topic has a whole section for these [1], and a section about this theory in particular [2].<p>Furthermore. The official accident report for crashes is not always considered the authoritative source for what happened. One good example is EgyptAir Flight 990 which the official report claims is a mechanical failure [3], but which is widely considered to have been pilot suicide. In that case the Egyptian investigative body was thought to be politically motivated.<p>Similarly, it&#x27;s not at all implausible that the French BEA would be reluctant to make conclusions that could result in the grounding of the entire worldwide Airbus fleet while they&#x27;re retrofitted with Boeing-style controls while France is the main Airbus manufacturing partner country.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Air_France_Flight_447#Independent_analyses\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Air_France_Flight_447#Independ...</a><p>2. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Air_France_Flight_447#Sidestick_control\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Air_France_Flight_447#Sidestic...</a><p>3. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;EgyptAir_Flight_990\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;EgyptAir_Flight_990</a>",
