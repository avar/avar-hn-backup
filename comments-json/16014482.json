This is how free software development works, if you have an itch you either scratch it yourself or pay someone to scratch it.<p>You wouldn&#x27;t want a FreeBSD that would be entirely funded by Netflix either, because nobody would be working on anything Netflix itself didn&#x27;t need, such a system would quickly end up being useless to you.",
