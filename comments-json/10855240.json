  "text" : "There are some people who are using &quot;free basics&quot; now that wouldn&#x27;t have any Internet access without it. Now, you could argue and I&#x27;d probably agree with you that it&#x27;s bad in the long term, creates a distorted market etc.<p>But if a foreign company offers a net subsidy to access a part of the Internet shouldn&#x27;t that drive down the price of Internet access for everyone? I.e. you could access &quot;free basics&quot; and also have a complimentary Internet subscription that could be offered at a lower price since your Facebook traffic would be subsidized.",
