Why do you\nprefer 28-56 over 14, or 28-56 over 18-46?<p>Before you mentioned that &quot;every artist on this list is dead&quot; as if it\nwere patently absurd for copyright to survive the author. Maybe it is,\nbut to use my previous example why would a talented author is his 80s\nwith young children write another novel if that were the case instead\nof going into the real estate business?<p><pre><code>    &gt; Yes, a Starship Troopers movie would have been released with\n    &gt; shorter copyright terms. It is cheaper to make a movie if you do\n    &gt; not have to pay for the IP.\n</code></pre>\nYou have to factor in movie studios being reluctant to base their\nworks on public domain work because it makes it harder to create a\nfranchise out of it. With a big hit like Starship Troopers being in\nthe public domain nothing&#x27;s stopping some other studio from releasing\nStarship Troopers 2, or selling action figures with that name etc.<p>It&#x27;s sometimes advantageous that a work you want to use is\ncopyrighted, because that means you can secure exclusive rights to\npublish a derived work based on it.",
