  "text" : "I&#x27;ve never had to file US taxes so this might be a stupid question, but how exactly are the people in your example worse off with ReadyReturn?<p>Isn&#x27;t ReadyReturn just e.g. summing up their reported wages for the return, which they&#x27;d need to do accurately anyway if they were filling it in from scratch?<p>Yes, if you have a pre-filled in tax return nothing that the government doesn&#x27;t know about &amp; which might be deductible is going to be on there, but that&#x27;s the situation you were in already, wasn&#x27;t it? Now you&#x27;ll have more time to fill that out, instead of doing menial work like manually summing up your monthly payslips to arrive at a yearly total.<p>Or is ReadyReturn somehow structurally flawed in allowing you to either file for a simplified pre-filled in return with no amendments, or having to do an old-style return from scratch?<p>When I file my taxes in The Netherlands all the concerns you&#x27;ve raised are addressed through a system where most of the information is pre-filled in. I.e. they know how much I make so that number is on there, but they might not know about a few other deductibles, those are established through a series of questions you answer.<p>E.g. &quot;do you own a house&quot; -&gt; &quot;what type of mortgage&quot; -&gt; &quot;do you pay a land use fee?&quot; -&gt; that&#x27;s a deductible (to cite one made-up example).<p>Most importantly it establishes a workflow where if something is a deductible (unless it&#x27;s something really obscure, manual returns still exist), it&#x27;s going to be on the online tax form.<p>So even if the initial implementation is bad just establishing that process is worthwhile, because there&#x27;ll be political pressure to make it better next year, and the year after that.",
