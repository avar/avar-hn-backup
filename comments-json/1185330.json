See this journal entry for some info about that: <a href=\"http://use.perl.org/~avar/journal/33585\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://use.perl.org/~avar/journal/33585</a><p>Maybe I'll resurrect some of that work once Perl 5.12 comes out and try dropping in RE2 and see how it compares to PCRE and Perl on the various edge cases involved.<p>This would be somewhat easier if RE2 supported Perl's syntax for named captures.",
