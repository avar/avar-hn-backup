  "text" : "The article is a badly written opinion piece that meanders through various topics, but your critique of it is beating a strawman.<p>It&#x27;s not making the &quot;you can&#x27;t win&quot; argument that tech companies should be critiqued whether or not they build housing.<p>Rather, it&#x27;s that they&#x27;re supposedly constructing &quot;company towns&quot; in the sense that the housing stock they build won&#x27;t be for sale, and presumably only rented to employees. If you get fired you also get evicted.<p>Furthermore they&#x27;ll own the nearby retail space as well. Will an Oculus competitor be for sale in the Facebook-owned chain of stores? Will someone trying to organize a Facebook union be allowed to use the meeting spaces at the Facebook town hall?",
