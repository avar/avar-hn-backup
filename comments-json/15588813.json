  "text" : "I may be wrong about this, but my understanding of the CC is that if say Nevada were to enact a law saying that sales to California were subject to tariff they wouldn&#x27;t be found to be in violation of the CC. Instead they&#x27;d be found in violation of some federal code that the government could enact <i>because</i> of the CC.<p>I.e. the CC isn&#x27;t some clause saying that free trade between states must be respected at all cost (sans the 21nd). Otherwise why would there be a federal drug law on the basis of the CC? That&#x27;s a prohibition of the sale of certain goods on the back of prohibiting sales across state lines on the back of the CC.<p>Hence the indirect reply to SeanLuke upthread. This is not a violation of the CC, but of some federal statute enacted on the basis of the CC.<p>The distinction matters because if the CC isn&#x27;t an amendment that ensures free trade the federal government could just as well use it to ensure trade restrictions between states as free trade, which it mostly does today.",
