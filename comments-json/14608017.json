  "text" : "On second look, yes that Guardian source is pretty shitty. I couldn&#x27;t find some authoritative source for the CO^2 emissions required to produce a new car. My point was that you had to consider it.<p><pre><code>    &gt; cars used for ride services will be replaced\n    &gt; more often.\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s not meaningful to consider how often they&#x27;re replaced, but what mileage they tend to get if we&#x27;re going to look at how the CO^2 cost of producing the car is amortized over its lifetime.<p>According to EPA statistics a typical car gets used for 100-200K miles[1], for taxis that number seems to be easily 2x or 3x larger[2]. So for the same amount of moving people from A to B taxis are mor CO^2 efficient.<p>Of course there are all sorts of secondary effects you&#x27;re not taking into account. Once people don&#x27;t own a car because they have something like Uber available to them, they&#x27;re more likely to use a bike or public transport for a trip they&#x27;d otherwise take by car. Just compare somewhere like NYC to LA in terms of how much CO^2 a typical person emits while going about their day.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the exact numbers are, but this is a lot more complex than what you&#x27;re making it out to be.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Car_longevity#Statistics\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Car_longevity#Statistics</a><p>2. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quora.com&#x2F;How-many-miles-does-a-NYC-taxi-do-in-its-life-as-a-taxi\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quora.com&#x2F;How-many-miles-does-a-NYC-taxi-do-in-i...</a>",
