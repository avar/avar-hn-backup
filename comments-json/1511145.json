That includes Python, Lisp, Lua, and others.<p>PHP has a Frankensteinian mix between the two. You /can/ implement it in any other language by just keeping an array along with your hash that indicates the order in which elements were inserted: <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Tie::StoredOrderHash\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Tie::StoredOrderHash</a><p>But you almost never want to do this. I've only used it once in all the PHP code I've written. And having to deal with the ambiguity of PHP's key-value array datatype wasn't worth it elsewhere wasn't worth that.",
