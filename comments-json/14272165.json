  "text" : "This is obviously just some guy&#x27;s mostly throwaway code, but FWIW it&#x27;s got the type of comments I don&#x27;t find useful at all when reading code. I.e. comments that purely duplicate what can be trivially inferred from code:<p><pre><code>    # retrieve data\n    data = json.loads(request_until_succeed(url))\n</code></pre>\nNot ambiguous, but better done by just naming the function in such a way that it&#x27;s obvious that it&#x27;s the thing retrieving the data. And:<p><pre><code>    num_processed = 0   # keep a count on how many we&#x27;ve processed\n</code></pre>\nIs another example of a comment that doesn&#x27;t compliment the code, but just distracts the reader from information they could equally, more accurately &amp; more briefly have gotten from reading the corresponding code.",
