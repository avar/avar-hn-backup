  "text" : "As another resident of Amsterdam. I don&#x27;t think your impression of the situation really matches up with statistics. Look at these two articles:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_countries_by_firearm-r...</a>\n<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;projects.oregonlive.com&#x2F;ucc-shooting&#x2F;gun-deaths\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;projects.oregonlive.com&#x2F;ucc-shooting&#x2F;gun-deaths</a><p>Here you can see the gun death rate in The Netherlands per 100k inhabitants is 0.58, but there&#x27;s some areas in the US where the rate is quite comparable.<p>What really sets things apart is the suicide rate, most deaths by guns in the US are by suicide, but there&#x27;s counties in the US where there&#x27;s easy access to guns and the overall death rate is lower than the Dutch gun violence + non-gun suicides.<p>So in a lot of cases it&#x27;s not that just having guns makes everything hyper-violent. It&#x27;s just that if people feel like killing themselves they&#x27;ll use the best available instrument available to them.<p>Conflating that with general gun safety as it pertains to you feeling safe walking around Amsterdam, but not in a comparable town in the US, is silly.",
