  "text" : "Much of Hiroshima wasn&#x27;t fully destroyed, and there were many survivors. Aside from the concerns about dud or destroyed missiles, you need a lot of missiles to destroy infrastructure that&#x27;s more spread out.<p>You&#x27;re also not just trying to destroy the 200 or so world capitals, but strategic assets in the US or the Soviet union. Between cities, military bases, power plants, factories and other infrastructure pertinent to waging war that 357 per capital number starts sounding a lot more reasonable.<p>This comparison is just another arbitrary irrelevant number journalists like to come up with that ultimately just serves \nto obscure the issue. It&#x27;s like describing the amount of concrete in the Hoover dam in terms of the volume of VW beatles.",
