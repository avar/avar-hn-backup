The parent of this thread quoted: &quot;And I did not chip in ten grand to seed a first investment round to build value for a Facebook acquisition.&quot;<p>If you didn&#x27;t chip in ten grand of seed money for that purpose <i>why didn&#x27;t you make that part of the deal then</i>?<p>There are no non-legal aspects of financial transactions. When you give someone money they&#x27;re going to try to retain that money and not give it back to you to the best of their legal ability. There really isn&#x27;t a non-legal aspect involved in it unless you&#x27;re a sucker who&#x27;s willing to get screwed over.<p>Who cares about the value of their reputation when they&#x27;ve been bought by Facebook for some undisclosed value? Surely that&#x27;s worth more to them than their reputation, seeing as they now have enough money to never work again with the people who&#x27;d care about their reputation.",
