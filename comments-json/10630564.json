I.e. one where I&#x27;m at no fault whatsoever by any reasonable definition and pose no future risk to society.<p>My point is that most people do recognize the importance of intent and future outcomes.<p><pre><code>    &gt; Results surely must play some role.\n</code></pre>\nThe more I think about it I don&#x27;t think they should.<p>Why do we put people in prison at all? Revenge is not an actual reason, which is where outcomes would matter. Future deterrence and security is a good reason. Killing someone isn&#x27;t primarily a crime against &#x2F;them&#x2F;, but a crime against society made up by people who&#x27;d like to not live their lives surrounded by likely murderers.<p>If that&#x27;s the goal it makes no sense to say &quot;oh he stabbed that guy, but missed the heart by an inch, that&#x27;s OK then&quot;. No it isn&#x27;t.<p><pre><code>    &gt; if he was trying to kill you using voodoo magic\n</code></pre>\nNow you&#x27;re just entering the realm of the absurd. I&#x27;m talking about cases where actual people actually want to kill you (successfully or not) and what we should actually be doing about that. Let&#x27;s stay on topic and not bring up silly contrived scenarios.",
