  "text" : "One of the inherent fallacies in your initial comment that I didn&#x27;t address, but which you&#x27;ve brought up here: Nobody makes anything the lingua franca, it&#x27;s something that happens organically.<p>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re as aware as I am why English is the current lingua franca. It&#x27;s mostly a historical accident, and it&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve got.<p>Whether the lingua franca might be English, Chinese or whatever is unrelated to your initial comment, which is what I was replying to.<p>There you were proposing that everyone should learn some artificial language for international communication. I think this is a bad idea for the reasons I stated above.<p>Now instead of defending your argument that we should all use some constructed language you&#x27;re off on a digression about why English and not Chinese, both of which are natural languages.",
