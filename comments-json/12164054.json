  "text" : "The article is discussing taller populations, not individuals. Within populations being tall tends to be a proxy metric for general prosperity, so of course it&#x27;s a positive.<p>Aside from that there seem to be intrinsic advantages to being tall. Taller people have bigger bodyparts, including bigger brains, and there&#x27;s a correlation between larger craniums and higher intelligence[1].<p>This doesn&#x27;t seem to be a very thoroughly studied subject though, but it really should be. If there&#x27;s anything we could be doing to increase the average intelligence of human species that&#x27;s going to pay dividends down the road.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Height_and_intelligence\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Height_and_intelligence</a>",
