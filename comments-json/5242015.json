  "text" : "I have a new Dell E6330 which is certified to run with Ubuntu, and came with it pre-installed: <a href=\"http://www.ubuntu.com/certification//hardware/201202-10559/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ubuntu.com/certification//hardware/201202-10559/</a><p>I immediately wiped it to install Debian (I'm not accepting a Dell EULA to run Linux) and found that the touchpad wasn't detected as such. Some digging revealed that there was a third party patch to linux reverse engineered from the Windows driver, not one contributed by Dell.<p>So it seems that their efforts to upstream code required to run their hardware on other distros than the OEM image are non-existant. The Ubuntu image that comes with them also possibly contains binarf blobs (didn't check since I didn't install it, but the Ubuntu page mentions than only the OEM image is certified, not stock Ubuntu).",
