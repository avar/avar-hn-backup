  "text" : "&gt; I meant Feynman&#x27;s later recounting of the whole affair<p>I&#x27;ve read that too. You&#x27;re dangerously close to getting me to re-read everything Feynman&#x27;s written, again. I don&#x27;t know whether to curse you or thank you :)<p>&gt; And then what? [...]<p>I feel we&#x27;re in violent agreement as to what the actual problem at NASA was, yes, I&#x27;m under no illusion that if some engineer had raised these issues it would have gone well for him. This is made clear in the opening words of Feynman&#x27;s analysis,:<p><pre><code>    [...] It appears that there are enormous differences of opinion as to the\n    probability of a failure with loss of vehicle and of human life. The\n    estimates range from roughly 1 in 100 to 1 in 100,000. The higher\n    figures come from the working engineers, and the very low figures from\n    management. What are the causes and consequences of this lack of\n    agreement? Since 1 part in 100,000 would imply that one could put a\n    Shuttle up each day for 300 years expecting to lose only one, we could\n    properly ask &quot;What is the cause of management&#x27;s fantastic faith in the\n    machinery?&quot;\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m pointing out, not to disagree with you, but just to use your comment as a springboard, that to an outside observer this whole process led to some &quot;moronic engineering&quot;. Engineering is the sum of the actual construction &amp; design process and the management structure around it.<p>The real flaw in the report is that it didn&#x27;t explore how that came to be institutional practice at NASA, Feynman is the only one who tried.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s really not what I read behind the lines.<p>Regardless of what sort of dysfunctional management practices there were at NASA they couldn&#x27;t have launched the thing without their engineers. If they were truly of the opinion that shuttle reliability was 3 orders of magnitude less than what management thought, perhaps they should have refused to work on it until that death machine was grounded pending review.<p>Of course that wouldn&#x27;t have been easy, but it&#x27;s our responsibility as engineers to consider those sorts of options in the face of dysfunctional management, especially when lives are on the line.",
