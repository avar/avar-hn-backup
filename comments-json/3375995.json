But most discoveries to be made in science are relatively mundane everyday things, and just a matter of paying attention in a structured manner.<p>E.g. most forms of life on the planet haven't been studied in any detail for the simple reason that nobody's gotten around to it yet, but the methods and tools to do so are much easier than they were 50 or 25 years ago.<p>Anyone can contribute to science, and it's now easier than ever before, and some of those contributions might unearth something we didn't expect.",
