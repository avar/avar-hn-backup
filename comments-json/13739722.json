  "text" : "The reason I&#x27;m not buying the PSRV is that it&#x27;s really hard to figure out if it&#x27;ll even work for me vis-a-vis the tracking camera.<p>I have a projector setup, so the PSRV camera has some propriterary cable running to it that I&#x27;d need to buy a third-party extension cord for, and who knows if that&#x27;ll work.<p>Even if I have that I can&#x27;t find any information on Sony&#x27;s site about where it&#x27;s acceptable to mount the camera relative to where you&#x27;re standing. Is it only OK if it&#x27;s directly in front of you, how about at a 45Â° incline etc?<p>Then, if I get all of that right I don&#x27;t have a lot of floor space in front of the projector (maybe 2x2 meters), they don&#x27;t say how far you&#x27;re expected to move around in the games you can buy.",
