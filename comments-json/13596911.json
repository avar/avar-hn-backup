  "text" : "&gt; Yes, I would prefer a US hegemony over an ISIS hegemony. The comparison itself is ridiculous.<p>Of course the comparison is ridiculous. That&#x27;s my whole point.<p>But this is the comparison the grandparent I&#x27;m replying to is making. I.e. that the U.S. bombs some countries while being concerned about civilian casualties, and terrorists respond with something like the 9&#x2F;11 attacks where they&#x27;re explicitly trying to inflict civilian casualties, and somehow this should make it less clear who the good &amp; evil actors are, as opposed to more clear.<p>&gt; But saying that the US has not used its military strength for its own benefit and at the expense of the people of other countries is ridiculous.<p>I&#x27;m struggling to see how you can read my comment and conclude that I&#x27;m trying to make that point, but needless to say, you&#x27;re fighting a strawman.",
