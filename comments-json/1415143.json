Just read the tutorial to get a grasp of the basic commands and concepts, and as soon as you read about the built-in help system you're good to go.<p>If you don't know what a key does you just prefix it with do `C-h k` to get help. If you can't recall the keybindings do `C-h b`, and if you've forgotten all of this do `C-h ?`. The entire manual is just a `C-h r` away.<p>The built-in documentation makes it really easy to learn more, it just takes patience.",
