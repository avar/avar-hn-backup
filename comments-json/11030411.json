  "text" : "Liability of all things is &quot;The. Critical. Question.&quot; when it comes to autonomous vehicles?<p>That&#x27;s such an amazingly American thing to say. Do you really think that the uptake of autonomous vehicles is going to be hindered to any significant degree by what are largely U.S.-specific legal issues?<p>Can you imagine a world in 2060 where the U.S. decides to leave something like 10-20% of GDP on the table because of the liability aspects of their legal environment? It might hinder uptake a bit but I don&#x27;t see it stopping it in the long run.<p>In any case regardless of what the U.S. does at that time the rest of the world is going to be driving autonomous vehicles.",
