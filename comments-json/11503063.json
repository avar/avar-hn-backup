  "text" : "Amazon doesn&#x27;t do this, and ship their own store. What do you think would happen if Samsung forked Android and didn&#x27;t ship the Play Store? Now app developers would just upload their apps to both stores and Google&#x27;s power over Android as a whole would be entirely eroded.<p>So no, they definitely don&#x27;t get to boss the OEMs around. Unlike Microsoft with Windows they don&#x27;t get to just say &quot;you can&#x27;t ship Windows^HAndroid anymore&quot;.<p>They do have a bit of hold over the OEMs in the form of it being a PITA to fork, access to Google&#x27;s own apps etc. So I&#x27;m not saying they have <i>no</i> leverage, but it&#x27;s a lot less than what Microsoft has, and definitely not enough to say &quot;my way or the highway&quot;.",
