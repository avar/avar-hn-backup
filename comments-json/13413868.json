E.g. some think tractors for fieldwork aren&#x27;t OK but lawnmowers are, for others somehow chainsaws are bad but washing machines are fine etc.<p>Looking these over there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any clear pattern to me. The grandparent mentioned them not wanting things that will &quot;drastically change their way of life&quot;, surely having a washing machine is a bigger change to your life than having a chainsaw, even if you&#x27;re a farmer.",
