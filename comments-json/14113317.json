  "text" : "A lot of mountaineering gear costs a <i>lot</i>, but lasts for a really long time. It&#x27;s like buying a car in some ways. So your go-to solution should be to buy used.<p>There&#x27;s no shortage of people who bought an $800 backpack along with $2000 of other gear, who thought they&#x27;d be using them regularly, who later find out that they made a significant investment in a hobby they don&#x27;t care much about.<p>Unless you&#x27;re swimming in money buying gear from those people should be your first choice.<p>Knowing what to buy is also a huge factor. E.g. the market for backpacks is a bit like the market for racing bikes. You can easily end up spending 3-4x what you actually need because you&#x27;re convinced that you need the latest &amp; greatest. A bit like the weekend warriors who buy $4000 carbon fiber racing bikes to shave of a couple of kilos, which, unless you&#x27;re competing, is a complete waste of money.",
