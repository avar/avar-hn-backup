  "text" : "Even in that situation there&#x27;s an element of avoidable &quot;own risk&quot; that could be priced into the premiums. Someone whose parked car gets hit by a drunk driver is more likely to:<p>- Not park their car in a garage overnight, exposing them to various damage to the car.<p>- Not park their car  in a garage when they go downtown.<p>- Park their car near bars or other places statistically more likely to have drunk drivers around.<p>I&#x27;m not saying your friend did any of that and that it wasn&#x27;t a complete freak accident, but on the scale of everyone that&#x27;s being insured there&#x27;s surely correlations like that that justify the premiums going up.",
