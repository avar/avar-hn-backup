Right now this is happening but the &quot;algorithm&quot; is some unpredictable twenty year old in uniform.<p>Are we going to have hearings auditing what the algorithm is like? is there going to be a scandal because isBrownPerson() is discovered in there somewhere? Is someone going to run it against a video collection of regular daily life and discover the drones would be indiscriminately bombing innocent situations if given the chance?<p>The end result is that we&#x27;re going to have to effectively have to come up with rules of engagement for every scenario. I think this will lead to war being fought more justly and with less collateral damage than ever before.",
