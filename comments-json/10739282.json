What bearing does suing the Wikimedia Foundation, a US entity, for material published in the US under US publishing laws?<p>The German Wikipedia is published and maintained by a US entity, there&#x27;s a local German Wikimedia chapter but it&#x27;s not the publisher of the German Wikipedia. The article says that they sued the US entity (the Wikimedia Foundation Inc., not Wikimedia Deutschland), but doesn&#x27;t explain this issue.",
