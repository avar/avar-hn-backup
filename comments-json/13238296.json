Contacted the seller, they gave me BS about &quot;Inzer is just what this type of belt is called&quot;, which is 100% untrue. It&#x27;s like saying thin grey laptops are called &quot;Apple&quot;.<p>So I contacted Amazon customer support about it. The guy kept trying to send me a return receipt, I said I didn&#x27;t want to return it, the product was fine for my use for the price, but they should fix the listing.<p>It&#x27;s still up in unchanged form today, although they&#x27;re currently out of stock: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.co.uk&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;B018N7POAM&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.co.uk&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;B018N7POAM&#x2F;</a>",
