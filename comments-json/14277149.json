  "text" : "Most of your comment is wrong. They&#x27;ve been discussing building a 1GW cable. 7000 times smaller than 7TW. A 7TW cable would be enough to transmit Iceland&#x27;s yearly electricity production 700 times over. It produces ~10GW per annum.<p>Hot water is not piped directly into the homes in Reykjavík, it&#x27;s heated up &quot;cold&quot; water, with artificially added sulfur. See another comment of mine here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14274085\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14274085</a><p>In Reykjavík the water you use is not recycled in any way, it&#x27;s pumped into a sewer from there into the ocean. It&#x27;s definitely not pumped the &gt;50 km back to Nesjavellir for reprocessing.",
