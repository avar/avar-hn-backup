The only reason (seemingly) that she got the job was that after the collapse of the previous government the new leftist coalition needed someone to pass the buck to, and she was pretty much the only uncontroversial figure they had.<p>Her coalition government's only redeeming quality has been to suck less than their predecessors which facilitated the giant ponzi scheme which took down the economy. They're wasting a lot of effort on the equivalent of rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.<p>One shining moment of incompetence was the press conference right after the president announced that the Icesave debt repayment bill would go to a public referendum.<p>She announced (well, mumbled actually) that the government was \"disappointed\" in the President's decision to bring the matter to a vote in a rushed international press conference hours after the announcement.<p>What they should have done is explain calmly that this was part of the democratic process in Iceland, and how the result might affect any future debt repayment.<p>Examples like these and countless others have shown that her and her government can't think two steps ahead, manage PR and foreign diplomacy horribly, and generally seem more interested in their pet leftist issues (which they can finally shove through, now that they're in power) rather than solving the problems facing the nation.<p>But what do I care, I moved abroad shortly after this all went down.",
