  "text" : "I&#x27;m sympathetic to your general point but it doesn&#x27;t seem very relevant to this discussion.<p>It&#x27;s one thing to have employment law where you can&#x27;t hire&#x2F;fire people at will. I agree that&#x27;s relatively inflexible and I&#x27;d prefer the American model (as a European). There&#x27;s no free lunch here, you either need to pay for this out of your taxes (as in France), or pay lower taxes and save for the unexpected loss of job yourself (as in the US).<p>It&#x27;s an entirely different thing that a company can&#x27;t meet its basic contractual obligations, i.e. the ability to pay salaries. That&#x27;s a case where a contract was made, there seems to be something very wrong with basic US corporate law that would allow this to happen, i.e. a company should have enough assets on hand to pay salaries in the event that it goes bankrupt.<p>In most of Europe companies are obligated to insure against this eventuality. I can&#x27;t drive a car on public roads without insurance, why should a company be allowed to operate if it isn&#x27;t insured against failure to meet its basic contract obligations?",
