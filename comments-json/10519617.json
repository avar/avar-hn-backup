See e.g. news articles about world leaders (&quot;Putin says Y&quot;) that don&#x27;t note that he actually said X in Russian, it was just translated into Y.<p>Now I&#x27;m curious, is it customary to note that such quotes are translated in German language news?<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a>",
