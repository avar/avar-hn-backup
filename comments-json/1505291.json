Why doesn't Wikileaks just host all their content in a Git repository and use GPG to sign their releases?<p>Then it would be impossible to take down the site, and anyone could easily spin up a mirror.<p>Instead there's one monolithic distribution site which isn't decoupled from their submission network. The site is frequently down during a fundraiser, and due to how they run it other people can't easily directly contribute resources to run mirrors of the site.<p>I'm beginning to think that Wikileaks is not as interested in actually getting leaks out as it is furthering Julian Assange's personal indispensability.",
