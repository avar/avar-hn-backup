  "text" : "The biggest revelation to me in that article, which I feel should be highlighted more, is that the Red Cross provides almost zero information about how it spends its money.<p>It refuses to provide more than very vague information about how the money was spent in Haiti (information like &quot;35% of $488 million on shelters&quot;), with no specific details about what projects they spent the money on, how those projects went etc.<p>When the author challenged the general counsel of the Red Cross to provide more detailed information (&quot;because clearly you must have it&quot;) he just gave her some evasive boilerplate spiel about having provided the summary information he&#x27;d provided already.<p>How can anyone donate to a charity that&#x27;s so stunningly opaque about how it spends its money?",
