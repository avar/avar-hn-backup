Either by adding SSL support to the programs themselves, or by setting up a tunnel.<p>That's not the same as using opportunistic encryption that can happen at the kernel level. You could <i>also</i> do that with SSL to achieve the same aims, but the point is that it's <i>opportunistic</i> and happens without further userspace configuration.",
