The US <i>also</i> relies on the ability to promptly respond to a first strike, which say the UK does not.<p>What I&#x27;m pointing out is that you&#x27;ve conflated two things. Just because one aspect of your deterrence is the ability to launch your land-based ICBMs within 30 minutes, that doesn&#x27;t mean that the inability to do so (e.g. because you don&#x27;t know who struck you) means that you&#x27;re out of options.<p>Besides, there&#x27;s no way someone could amass enough SLBMs in the Pacific to take out two aspects of the US&#x27;s nuclear triad without the US knowing who owns those submarines.",
