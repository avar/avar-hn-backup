  "text" : "I don't see why this is unreasonable. Right now it's basically a pretty easy way to evade taxes with freebies.<p>Don't have enough money for the payments on your house? No problem, just offer to take a pay cut and move into a \"free\" house provided by your employer. Alcohol sales tax too high in your state? No problem, just open a bar with \"free\" alcohol and charge an entry fee to the premises at the door.<p>In The Netherlands where I reside my employer provides \"free\" meals but they have to charge me 2 EUR for each one as a matter of law. In some other countries if you give out \"free\" beers to people you have to pay a mandatory minimum fee for each one etc.<p>If you don't do that then the optimum financial endgame for a company like Google is to basically turn into some mega corporation that pays its employees almost minimum wage, but provides \"free\" meals, housing, food, transportation etc. which they don't have to pay any taxes on because it's not being sold to anyone and can all be written off as internal costs.<p>Compensation isn't just handing someone a dollar bill.",
