And are those features absolutely critical to running it at all?<p>What I&#x27;ve read sounds more like &quot;we&#x27;re focusing on Linux, and won&#x27;t be porting it&quot; rather than &quot;this software is inherently Linux-only, and can&#x27;t be ported&quot;.<p>I daresay coming up with a shimmy layer to port it to BSD is probably less effort than completely rewriting it.",
