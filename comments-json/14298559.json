Leaving the Falklands aside, it should be obvious that a map like this is rather one sided and certainly doesn&#x27;t have any international recognition given that no sovereign claim over the Antarctic is recognized by the UN or anyone else.<p>Aside from that I think you&#x27;re misunderstanding what this map means. There&#x27;s an international convention on continental shelves but national sovereignty supersedes it. There&#x27;s no rule that if your continental shelf intersects territory intersects some island you own that island.<p>If it did then China would own Taiwan, France &#x2F; Belgium &#x2F; The Netherlands &amp; Norway would own the British isles, South Korea would own Japan etc.",
