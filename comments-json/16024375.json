  "text" : "How many people do you know who smoke? A lot of middle and lower-class people smoke.<p>Some searching reveals that the smoking rate is north of 25% in both France and Belgium, and a pack of cigarettes in France is 7 EUR, let&#x27;s round that down to 5.<p>So for a 110 EUR (~$130) meal we&#x27;re talking about the equivalent of 26 days of 1 pack a day smoking, or just under 2 weeks of 2 pack a day.<p>Which I believe eloquently makes the point that you&#x27;re out of touch with just how much $130 of disposable income over a year is.<p>We&#x27;re talking about saving 30 cents&#x2F;day, hardly out of reach of even the poorest of people who&#x27;d like to treat themselves to something like an expensive restaurant on a yearly basis.",
