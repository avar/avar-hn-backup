If they don&#x27;t like it they can vote again and leave the agreement.<p>If it&#x27;s not obvious from my comments I&#x27;m not <i>advocating</i> for agreements like the TTIP or other agreements that enforce international trade in this comment chain.<p>I&#x27;m just saying that <i>if</i> people want agreements like that in some shape or form that&#x27;s going to necessarily result in some loss of national sovereignty. Any international trade agreement worth its salt will do that.<p>As an example. Let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s been an agreement between the US and Germany to enforce no tariffs on their trade. Now Germany is massively subsidizing its steel industry and there&#x27;s a Delaware startup trying to smelt steel to compete with them.<p>Don&#x27;t you think there should be a dispute mechanism in place to say &quot;hey guys, we agreed to no tariffs, that really doesn&#x27;t make sense if you subsidize steel and we don&#x27;t&quot;.?",
