  "text" : "Does Michigan have worse weather than Bergen? The wettest city in Norway, situated 6Â° south of the Arctic circle? I'm willing to bet not.<p>Bergen has seen a boom in percentage of trips made by bike since they instituted a program to make the city more friendly to that mode of transportation.<p>Cities being designed around the automobile are by far the biggest thing standing in the way of the uptake of everyday cycling, not the weather.",
