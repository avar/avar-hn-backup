After all how long can the paid-for editor wars persist?<p>What I was pointing out is that there&#x27;s no sign of them opening up anything that would truly make them an open source company. I.e. things they make real money on, or would threaten their established lock-in.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.visualstudio.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;how-to-buy-vs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.visualstudio.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;how-to-buy-vs</a>",
