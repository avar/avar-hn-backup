Recently they send me some E-Mail to the effect of &quot;Awesome! Your image on &lt;business name&gt; has been viewed 100 thousand times!&quot; or something like that.<p>It entirely turned me off the whole thing and I haven&#x27;t contributed since. I thought &quot;why am I contributing to this ad-powered product that they&#x27;re monetizing for millions, for free?&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s kind of hilarious really. If you look at their landing page the benefits you can gain include things like &quot;...and you can also moderate our forums, for us, for free!&quot;: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;local&#x2F;guides&#x2F;benefits&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;local&#x2F;guides&#x2F;benefits&#x2F;</a><p>Yay!",
