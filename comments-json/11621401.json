  "text" : "You wouldn&#x27;t need to abolish property rights. Another way to look at it is that you&#x27;d essentially transfer the cost of social programs to people through insurance instead of through taxation.<p>Additionally you&#x27;d create a pressure in society to increase wealth equality &#x2F; charity and opportunities for the needy &#x2F; poor, since nobody likes to be stolen from all the time.<p>Right now the poor are an abstract problem for many, especially the rich, if you ran the risk of being stolen from directly maybe you&#x27;d have a stake in increasing wealth equality. Or maybe you&#x27;d just hire private security.<p>It might actually be a better system, or it might not, who knows?",
