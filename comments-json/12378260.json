Nothing about them says the can&#x27;t enter into an agreement\nto create a pan-national body to settle trade disputes, as opposed to\nescalating every incident to a diplomatic dispute.<p>If people don&#x27;t like that they&#x27;ll make in an election issue, and\neither it&#x27;ll be re-negotiated after the next election or the nation\nwill leave the trade agreement. That&#x27;s the democratic process at work.<p>How is that a better option anyway? So now instead of some court that\nhas to be seen to be fair to the entire trade block deciding things,\nyou want to have n^2 potential dispute mechanisms in place between the\nn countries that are part of the agreement?<p><pre><code>    &gt; big international corporations [...] don&#x27;t like the fact that\n    &gt; governments can create laws that they are obliged to respect.\n</code></pre>\nOr you could look at this from the flip side of that argument, which\nis that it&#x27;s detrimental to international trade if companies can&#x27;t\nmake international investments without being at risk to domastic\npolitical whimsy that runs counter to the spirit of the trade deal\nthat was initially agreed upon.",
