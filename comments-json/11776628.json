  "text" : "As a non-native English speaker I think this is a horrible idea. So rather than for us to all communicate in English which is spoken natively by around half a billion, you&#x27;d rather international communication take place in a language nobody speaks natively?<p>That seems like a horrible idea. When the lingua franca is some common natively spoken language at least people who can confidently correct you exist.<p>Having everyone speak a non-native language would just lead to a regression towards the mean, and such a language would be much harder to learn than any existing language because it wouldn&#x27;t come with a culture. There would be very few books, movies etc. in that language.",
