  "text" : "In Iceland in particular (and I'm guessing a lot of countries have the same situation) what'll happen is that the Ministry of Education will publish some official recommendation about what formats should be used, or that free/open source software should be \"strongly considered\".<p>Then what happens in practice is that everyone just ignores that recommendation and buys proprietary software anyway, feigning compatibility with existing systems, re-training costs etc.<p>So in practice a government recommendation about ODF can mean absolutely nothing unless you really make it mandatory. So this map on Wikipedia is effectively useless as an indicator for \"adoption\". It's probably actually a map of what governments have made feel-good press releases about ODF.",
