  "text" : "Yes, of course some people will hate it so much that they&#x27;ll boycott the service, whether it&#x27;s games with DLC or airlines.<p>But my point is that a much larger segment of the population just likes to complain, and if you listen to what they&#x27;re saying you&#x27;ll get an inaccurate picture of reality.<p>For example, people who complain about the state of seats on airplanes while choosing not to book &quot;economy plus&quot; or &quot;economy comfort&quot; or whatever it&#x27;s called, which often isn&#x27;t more expensive than the equivalent of one sit-down meal and a beer at a cheap restaurant.<p>But those people won&#x27;t say &quot;listen, all other things being equal I&#x27;d prefer a bit more room, but honestly I&#x27;d rather save $40 to put up with a bit of discomfort to eat at a better restaurant once I land&quot;.<p>Even though that&#x27;s the description that best matches reality given the data at hand. Instead they&#x27;ll go on some tirade about how really they fly so much less than they used to, meanwhile air travel is increasing all over the world and we&#x27;d have to assume market researchers for all these airlines are idiots because there&#x27;s some huge market segment for the taking if they&#x27;d only increase leg room a bit.<p>Which they&#x27;ll try, but they&#x27;ll quickly find out that while people complain they&#x27;re really not prepared to pay an extra $40 for it. So here we are.",
