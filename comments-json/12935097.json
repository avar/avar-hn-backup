  "text" : "I was deeply into Nintendo games in the late 90s leading up to Wind Waker&#x27;s release. I remember after it was announced that so many people were deeply disappointed in these &quot;kiddy&quot; graphics.<p>Remember that as far as the major releases go it was released in 2002 after Ocarina of Time in 1998 (and a sequel using the same engine in 2000).<p>People wanted a &quot;real&quot; Zelda game with &quot;real&quot; graphics, like what became Twilight Princess in 2006, whose graphics are a logical follow-up to Ocarina of Time.<p>It&#x27;s funny how history turns out, now Wind Waker is widely lauded for its graphics, and it looks much better than the likes of Ocarina of Time or Twilight Princess.<p>It&#x27;s a fantastic example of how Nintendo is still a company that dares to experiment, even with their most wildly successful game franchises. That hasn&#x27;t always worked out, but we&#x27;ve gotten amazing innovative games like Wind Waker as a result.",
