Imagine trying to explain to someone living in the 90s that they just <i>have</i> to watch this one TV show <i>right now</i>.<p>Surely they could just walk down to their local video rental store, not that many people really need to watch something right now!<p>But once something like BitTorrent &amp; Netflix happens it becomes the new expectation.
