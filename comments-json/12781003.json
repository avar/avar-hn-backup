  "text" : "For plenty of people something like the weather or the government really is the reason they moved.<p>The government was a major reason for my move. I moved after the collapse, which was entirely caused by Iceland&#x27;s dysfunctional government policies (none of which have really changed), and the measures put into place post-collapse largely benefited homeowners at the expense of the rest of us.<p>I didn&#x27;t want to spend the next decade paying for other people&#x27;s bad financial decisions at the cost of the currency &amp; my purchasing power having fallen around 1&#x2F;2.<p>Similarly people move from say the UK to Spain for the weather. As I&#x27;m sure you know Iceland doesn&#x27;t just have &quot;bad&quot; weather, it&#x27;s on a whole different level where working around the weather often becomes a major logistical difficulty. Whole towns often become snowed in during the winter.<p>So it&#x27;s hardly a surprise that someone would move just to be rid of that.",
