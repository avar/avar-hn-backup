This is the first time it gets me into trouble.<p>FWIW it doesn&#x27;t change the submitted text directly, but I edited a spelling error in my comment which changed &quot;iCloud&quot; to &quot;iButt&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s also a an extension that replaces &quot;God&quot; with &quot;Nicolas Cage&quot; that I recommend :)",
