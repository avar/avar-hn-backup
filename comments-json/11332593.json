Thus killing all chance of acquiring a userbase now that\n    &gt; I had hit the frontpage.\n    &gt;\n    &gt; When I went onto the IRC GAE channel to ask someone for help to\n    &gt; unlock or keep the app running during this important moment the\n    &gt; reply from a staff member was &#x27; You should have planned better&#x27;. I\n    &gt; was surprised to hear this response and did not pursue the matter\n    &gt; further. Its all in the IRC logs if any of this sounds doubtful.\n    &gt;\n    &gt; TL;DR; Surprisingly, I did not find the GAE platform to be a\n    &gt; supportive environment for startups.\n    &gt;\n    &gt; ionwake @ ~2016-03-21 22:xx UTC</code></pre>",
