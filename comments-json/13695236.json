  "text" : "The money quote from the book is:<p><pre><code>    &gt; [...] What made it possible for me to exercise\n    &gt; freedom of choice also made it impossible for me\n    &gt; to know the future. Conversely, now that I know\n    &gt; the future, I would never act contrary to that\n    &gt; future, including telling others what I know.\n</code></pre>\nI.e. her situation is completely analogous to Paul Atreides in\nDune. She can see the future, she can change events, but if she ever\ndid she couldn&#x27;t see the future anymore. So she throws her daughter\nunder the metaphorical bus to retain her powers.<p>I think it&#x27;s a rather bleak story, &quot;woman can see future events,\nprefers to live out the spoiler version of her life rather than\nchanging anything and being surprised&quot;, but whatever, at least it&#x27;s\ninternally consistent.<p>What I&#x27;m pointing out is that the storyline of the movie makes\nabsolutely no sense, because there she can see the future <i>and</i> is\nable to change events based on that information, not lose her seeing\npowers, and seemingly create time loops where people in the future\nonly did certain things because she did them in the present, based on information they gave her in the future because she did that!<p>The movie tries to evade this problem with a slight of hand. They\nchange the circumstances of her daughter&#x27;s death to be inevetable,\notherwise the audience would be up in arms at the obvious\ncontradiction that she can change the future based on seeing what\nGeneral Shang is going to do, but somehow can&#x27;t tell her daughter not\nto take up climbing as a hobby.",
