There&#x27;s always going to be some people who buy new and others who buy used, think used cars, clothes etc.<p>Phones &amp; laptops are now a mature technology, the days when you need a new computer to run spreadsheets or browse the Internet are over. Nowadays a 5 year old computer is just as good for pretty much any application except AAA games.<p>The GP was mentioning students as needing phones &amp; laptops. I&#x27;m pointing out that students in particular think nothing of buying say used clothes because they don&#x27;t have a lot of money, but for some reason a lot more people have expensive new gadgets they don&#x27;t need.",
