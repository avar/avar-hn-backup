All I&#x27;ve been pointing out that from looking at the homicide &amp; gun death statistics in the US you can&#x27;t conclude that guns are important variable driving those statistics.<p><pre><code>    &gt; we&#x27;re [..] not talking about suicides [...]\n    &gt; Stop injecting them into the discussion.\n</code></pre>\nYou&#x27;re the one who started injecting suicides into the discussion. In your earlier comment[1] you said, in response to a graph[2] I posted that included non-suicide numbers, which is the part I was citing, that the &quot;lowest groups are 2-7&quot;. Those numbers include gun suicides, whereas I wasn&#x27;t talking about that at all but the other data on the page which shows gun homicide statistics similar to the Dutch 0.58.<p>But since you muddied the water by bringing up these unrelated suicide numbers, I started to itemize the suicide &amp; the non-suicide you were conflating them with, and now a few comments later you&#x27;re complaining about my discussing something you brought up in the first place.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14034308\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14034308</a><p>2. <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;projects.oregonlive.com&#x2F;ucc-shooting&#x2F;gun-deaths\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;projects.oregonlive.com&#x2F;ucc-shooting&#x2F;gun-deaths</a>",
