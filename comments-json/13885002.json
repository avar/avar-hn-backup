The last major Guile release was 6 years ago, and much of this GuileEmacs work is still highly WIP and from my searching on emacs-devel seems to have stalled in 2015 for lack of volunteers.<p>Just because Guile implements Elisp the <i>language</i> doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t a ton of work to be done on Emacs itself to swap out its native VM for Guile, and it seems nobody&#x27;s keen on finishing up that work.",
