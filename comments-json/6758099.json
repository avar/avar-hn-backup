  "text" : "Partly yes, but being able to control the macro economy is arguably a much greater power in a western state than the monopoly on coercive force.<p>Force mostly has to be individually applied, and you can only take it so far before you have massive pushback in the form of civil unrest.<p>Printing money, to pick a simple example, is much more effective and can be done across the economy as a whole.<p>Could you imagine police forces breaking into everyone&#x27;s home and taking half their cash in a matter of days? It&#x27;s unthinkable that that would happen for logistical reasons alone.<p>But that&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve effectively seen some modern western governments do just recently by rapidly deflating their currencies.<p>Abolishing fiat currency would take away that power, and make no mistake it is an immense power. It&#x27;s the power to shape entire economies at the stroke of a pen.",
