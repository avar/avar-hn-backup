  "text" : "No, it&#x27;s not fraud. Yes the car is now worth €11000, but it&#x27;s not taxed on its ticket price, it&#x27;s taxed on what it is. It&#x27;s a car, and a car includes seats, a car stereo (albeit now a very expensive one), an engine etc.<p>Nobody&#x27;s trying to undervalue the car as costing €1,000 with a €10,000 stereo, that would be fraud.<p>The point is that by introducing differences in what sort of taxes you have to pay for certain products you trivially open yourself up to <i>legal</i> tax evasion in the form of simply bundling higher cost items as part of products in lower tax categories.<p>Perhaps a better example: Let&#x27;s say you have a 200% tax on cylindrical metal tubes, but a 10% tax on bicycles. A lot of people would now legally import bicycle frames, cut them apart, and evade the import fees without the authorities being able to do anything about it. There&#x27;s nothing illegal about buying a bicycle frame, and there&#x27;s nothing illegal about cutting apart your bicycle and re-using it for parts.",
