There&#x27;s no incentive to cancel.\n    &gt; People don&#x27;t do that.\n</code></pre>\nThere are trivial no-brainer cases where the potential for free cancellations allows you to offload costs on someone else.<p>E.g. you and your 4 friends need to get from A-&gt;B together, you each order an Uber for the ride, but you only intend to use one car. The ETAs are in the range of 15-25 minutes, you all have the &quot;Fake Battery Status&quot; app installed &amp; cancel 3 of the cars when the first one has an ETA of &lt; 2 minutes.<p>Now you&#x27;re able to get where you need to go 5-10 minutes earlier than you otherwise would have, at no extra cost, but you&#x27;ve incurred a cost on Uber &amp; lost opportunity (&amp; real fuel costs) on the driver.",
