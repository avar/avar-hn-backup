I&#x27;ve been to Singapore a few times though, and have eaten in the Chinatown hawker center discussed in the article several times so I thought I&#x27;d correct beachstartup&#x27;s misconception of it.<p>It&#x27;s certainly nothing like a &quot;food court inside of a shopping mall&quot; and the comment that it&#x27;s &quot;frequented by affluent professionals&quot; is laughable. People from all walks of life eat in Singaporean hawker centers.<p>By &quot;street food&quot; in the western sense I assumed beachstartup was talking about mobile hot dog &#x2F; kebab stands you can find in the US, or similar (but more often stationary) stands you can find on the street in many European cities.<p>I don&#x27;t remember any of that in Singapore, although I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it exists. Instead the demand for street food is satisfied by hawker centers.",
