I don't see them organizing lynch mobs for similar but much more inhumane acts against farm animals happening in their own communities. Would people care if this was a litter of pigs? Or a litter of rats?<p>And leaving aside this specific example, most people on this planet in rural communities don't have the economic means to employ a dedicated medical professional to put down their excess cats and dogs.<p>For those people drowning the animals is a perfectly legitimate option, it sure beats watching them starve to death.<p>Ignoring all of this and going straight to \"oh those poor puppies, what a horrible person\" as most people seem to respond is, I think, a privileged western viewpoint.",
