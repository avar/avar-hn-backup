I've been running it in a VirtualBox, and while it has some bugs it's also a wonderful addition to Debian. They've just recently got the userspace ZFS tools working on a FreeBSD 8.1 kernel running a GNU userland and a GNU C library.<p>We're heading for a brave new world where the kernel is just another package, not some immutable part of the whole system.",
