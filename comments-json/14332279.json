  "text" : "Thanks a lot for that reference. I listened to that episode, it&#x27;s got a really interesting idea related to a &quot;marketplace for organs&quot; that I hadn&#x27;t heard about before.<p>They describe setting up a consensual &quot;kidney club&quot;. The idea being that if you&#x27;re in the club and need a kidney, one member of the club is chosen at random and compelled to give you a kidney, but likewise if you have kidney failure and would otherwise die you get a kidney from a random member.<p>This sidesteps the usual concerns about implementing a marketplace for organs. I.e. even if you&#x27;re a billionaire the only way to insure yourself against kidney failure is to enter the pool of potentially mandatory donors, and you can of course stay outside the &quot;kidney club&quot; and not have to donate to anyone, but then you also die if you have kidney failure.<p>Katz points out that the reason this doesn&#x27;t work is that current law can&#x27;t compel you to donate your organs, even if you&#x27;ve previously signed a contract to that effect, but that this creates a market failure &amp; tragedy of the commons.<p>Implementing a system like this seems like a no-brainer and a benefit for everyone involved, but it&#x27;s blocked by current contract law &amp; the inability to force people to undergo medical procedures they consented to in the past.",
