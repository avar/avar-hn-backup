There should be unified standards.<p>Saying that you should just let the free market handle it is the libertarian idea that now every company needs to have expertise in international politics in order to invest or do business, as opposed to just having a well regulated market.<p><pre><code>    &gt; Both countries have court systems\n    &gt; dating several hundred years back.\n</code></pre>\nWhich doesn&#x27;t mean that those courts are compatible in their decisions, or would treat foreigners fairly, which is what the ISDS addresses.<p><pre><code>    &gt; Another market solution is insurance.\n</code></pre>\nI.e. wasted capital because of uncertainty incurred by a lack of free trade guarantees, something a free trade agreement would address. We could just not waste that capital to begin with.<p>The entire point of a free trade agreement is to remove those hurdles where you don&#x27;t have to buy insurance or hedge your bets just to sell something to another country.",
