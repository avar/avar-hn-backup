I&#x27;m just saying that has nothing to do with having a heterogeneous population as the parent was claiming.<p>The parent was comparing the proportion of physicians in Cuba v.s. the US and claiming that the US couldn&#x27;t match Cuba because of its heterogeneous population.<p>Now if you look at the WHO report on density of physicians[1] you see first-wold countries like Japan and Canada ranking below the US on the number of physicians per-capita.<p>I think numbers like these have a lot more to do with how the health care system is structured than the sort of population you have. E.g. maybe nurses in Japan and Canad have a bigger role in health care than the US.<p>1. <a href=\"http://www.who.int/gho/health_workforce/physicians_density/en/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.who.int&#x2F;gho&#x2F;health_workforce&#x2F;physicians_density&#x2F;e...</a>",
