  "text" : "No law has been passed yet, this is a \"proposal for a parliamentary resolution\" (þingsályktunartillaga). Which basically means that parliament has expressed formal interest in getting legislation drafted to implement this.<p>How that legislation will look will depend on a lot of committee work down the road, and what parliament actually ends up passing is another open question.<p>Still, this proposal has the backing of several ministries, so there's a large change that something good will be passed. But whether it'll fulfill all the promises of the IMMI plan remains to be seen.",
