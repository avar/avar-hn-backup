I&#x27;m replying to your economic fallacy of\nasserting that &quot;[a] program for a million people will cost more [than\na program for one person]&quot;. Of course that&#x27;s <i>literally</i> true in terms\nof absolute dollar amounts, but it&#x27;s not true in the sense that\nactually matters. I.e. if you had a million extra people in your\ncountry would they be a net drain on your economy, or net\ncontributors?<p>To answer that question it doesn&#x27;t matter that they&#x27;re illegal\nimmigrants or legal immigrants. You can&#x27;t assume that just because\nsomeone&#x27;s illegal they&#x27;re more likely to be a net drain on the\neconomy, actually the reverse is probably likelier to be true, since\nan illegal immigrant will seek work but can&#x27;t make use of social\nservices provided to people legally in the country.<p><pre><code>    &gt; I&#x27;m not assuming that [illegal immigrants are a\n    &gt; net drain on the economy] at all.\n</code></pre>\nI really hate to put words into someone&#x27;s mouth, but the most generous\nreading of what you&#x27;re saying really does sound like that&#x27;s what\nyou&#x27;re actually saying.<p>You&#x27;re asserting that having X number of &quot;illegal&quot; immigrants is going\nto have some linear drain on the economy as a function of X, it&#x27;s not\nat all clear that that relationship exists in any sense, i.e. it could\nbe a gain not a drain, and it could be non-linear.",
