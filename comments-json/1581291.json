Debian GNU/kFreeBSD isn't going to be a replacement for FreeBSD any time soon for the people that prefer it.<p>But it's an excellent alternative for Debian users who'd like to use ZFS and other FreeBSD features without throwing the rest of Debian out with the bathwater.<p>This'll also be wonderful for the BSD's in terms of increasing the portability of packages in Debian that they might want to pick up.",
