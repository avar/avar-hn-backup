  "text" : "No I meant a wetsuit. Wetsuits are completely waterproof aside from a select few entry points where water is allowed to seep through as you first get in the water.<p>The idea behind their operation is that you have a thin film of warm water around your body, isolated by a waterproof neophrene layer. So there's: The Sea -&#62; neophrene -&#62; Warm water that doesn't freely mix with the sea -&#62; You.<p>That doesn't work (as deadmansshoes thought) if you're wearing normal clothes instead of a neophrene layer. In that case the water next to your body is constantly being replaced by new &#38; cold water, faster than you can heat it up to provide you with insulation.<p>Both wetsuit and drysuits depend on there being a layer next to your body that you heat up. With wetsuits this is a layer of water that doesn't get swapped out, with drysuits it's a layer of air + rubber.",
