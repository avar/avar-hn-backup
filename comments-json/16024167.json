  "text" : "The second edition of Jack Bogle&#x27;s &quot;Little Book of Common Sense Investing&quot; came out this last October. It goes into detail in evaluating active investment such as what&#x27;s being recommended in this article v.s. passive investment.<p>Plainly put, I&#x27;ve yet to see any compelling evidence that the supposed experts being quoted in this article can time the market as they&#x27;re suggesting with their suggestion of getting out of tech stocks now.<p>The percentage of active management firms that can beat the index funds even before you factor in their high fees is so miniscule that random chance could account for those low numbers.<p>The market&#x27;s almost definitely heading for a bit of a crash in a few years, but it&#x27;s instructive to look at how passive v.s. active investing did in 2008 (detailed in this book) to see how much these supposed experts really know.",
