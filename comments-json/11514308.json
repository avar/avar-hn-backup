We used to have the computers you&#x27;re describing. They were made by SGI and the hardware &amp; OS made all sorts of guarantees like the ones you&#x27;re describing, to the point where XFS was ported to Linux x86 initially it had all sorts of bugs that simply couldn&#x27;t happen on SGI machines.<p>The x86 boxes were cheaper, nobody really cared enough about hardware reliability enough to pay the price for the likes of SGI, and the rest is history. Today we have a &quot;worse is better&quot; hardware architecture and software has to be able to handle it.",
