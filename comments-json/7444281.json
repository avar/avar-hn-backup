  "text" : "From the perspective of someone living in mainland Europe the legislation around bars in the U.S. is quite baffling.<p>I was over in San Francisco last summer and walked out of a bar pint in hand to tag along for a cigarette break, we were promptly chastised about it. I apologized saying that I&#x27;d briefly forgotten what continent I was on.<p>It&#x27;s also not unusual to see children milling around with their parents in bars in Europe well into the evening. There&#x27;s no demand that you have to be of drinking age to be in the establishment, just that you can&#x27;t be sold drinks if that&#x27;s not the case.<p>All in all it contributes to a more relaxed atmosphere around drinking and I suspect to overall moderation and safety around drinking.<p>If you ban guns in bars then someone who carries a gun around anyway will have to stash it somewhere before they arrive, or risk breaking the law.<p>I carry a swiss army knife on my keychain because it&#x27;s a useful tool, I bring that to bars I go to. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m any more likely to attempt to stab someone after a few pints than I otherwise would.",
