  "text" : "The US is peculiar with its nuclear policy in trying to guarantee immediate response, by contrast say the UK only has nuclear submarines at sea, and it&#x27;s expected that there&#x27;ll be nothing like an immediate response, rather the captains of those submarines will find out who nuked the UK and respond.<p>So the answer for deterrence purposes is you don&#x27;t need to nuke anyone right away, immediate response is only one layer of the onion when it comes to nuclear deterrence.",
