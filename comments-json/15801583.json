  "text" : "The proponents of both have, in the words of a paper on the subject[1] agreed that &quot;the two achieve the same distributive outcome through an appropriate tax-benefit system, [but] are fundamentally different from economic and ethical points of view&quot;.<p>Consider trying to introduce a universal health care system. You might say why do we need a system that subsidizes Jeff Bezos&#x27;s health care? He can damn well pay for it himself, he might even agree since it&#x27;s going to cost him less in terms of his tax contributions.<p>That&#x27;s the equivalent of trying to sell NIT. Right out of the gate you have to not say &quot;this is for everyone&quot; but &quot;it&#x27;s just for the poor, but don&#x27;t worry because...&quot;. That&#x27;s what I mean by the marketing being different.<p>Of course with UBI the benefit is literally fungible, it&#x27;s money. So it&#x27;s really not like universal health care, but in the minds of a lot of people it is. They find it easier to accept the state providing a service if it&#x27;s provided to them as well, even though it&#x27;s a net cost center for them.<p>Humans.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de&#x2F;2052&#x2F;1&#x2F;MPRA_paper_2052.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de&#x2F;2052&#x2F;1&#x2F;MPRA_paper_2052.pdf</a>",
