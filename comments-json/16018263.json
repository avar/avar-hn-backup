  "text" : "Agreed, overall they&#x27;re safe. I&#x27;m just pointing out that the time of the phase-out in the US is effectively FAA-mandated due to the airlines not wanting to retrofit the fleet, as e.g. BA has apparently done.<p>This is an interesting bit of trivia, and not something you&#x27;ll find in airline press releases since for better or worse it&#x27;s going to make them look worse in the eyes of their customers.<p>There&#x27;s ~500 747s[1] in service. So 30k&#x2F;500 =~ 60yrs, or a 25% chance that one will blow up in the next 15 years. So this seems like a reasonable retrofit given the cost.<p>I assume that the FAA knows what it&#x27;s doing and 12% oxygen helps, even if it&#x27;s not 9%, similarly I assume they&#x27;ve taken into account the risk of retrofitting existing planes, since they started explicitly mandating that in 2008.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_Boeing_747_operators#Airline_operators_at_July_2017\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_Boeing_747_operators#A...</a>",
