I&#x27;m disappointed in Oculus too, and I&#x27;d be even more disappointed if I&#x27;d actually invested in them.<p>I&#x27;m just saying that people need to learn the hard lesson that when they&#x27;re &quot;investing&quot; in something like Kickstarter they&#x27;re not actually &quot;investing&quot; in the general sense. They&#x27;re making a donation with little or no string attached, at best it&#x27;s a &quot;you give us money and we send you some doodad in the mail&quot; investment.<p>So they&#x27;re effectively donating money with no string attached.<p>So if you donated money to the company thinking they were going to do X and they actually do Y they <i>can and will fuck you over</i> if they think they can make more money doing Y than they can doing X, accounting for all the alienation from their existing customers from doing not doing X.<p>So please everyone, if you want to invest in something and you want to have the expectations of an investor make sure you&#x27;re actually <i>investing</i>, not just <i>donating</i>.",
