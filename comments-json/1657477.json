But your bad experience with BitTorrent is probably purely a function of using the wrong trackers.<p>I have access to some trackers where the download very rarely goes below 2MB/s, with 5-8MB/s being the average. Some of these have material like discontinued music and foreign films that I could never get where I live, at least not without significant hassle.<p>With this setup I can initiate a download for a foreign 720p film, go and make some tea, and it'll be there by the time I come back.<p>That's quality of service I can't even pay for where I live, no matter how much cash I fork out.",
