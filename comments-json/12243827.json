  "text" : "It&#x27;s not inside a mall, it&#x27;s in a hawker center, a complex that doesn&#x27;t have traditional shopping and is literally many levels of nothing but small one-man eateries.<p>Saying that it&#x27;s not &quot;street food&quot;, I think, glosses over the context of what these things are in Singapore.<p>There was a concerted effort by the government at some point to bring what were &quot;street food&quot; stalls in the western sense into regulated hawker centers for hygienic reasons.<p>There&#x27;s almost no &quot;street food&quot; in the western sense in Singapore, for a combination of that reason and the fact that it&#x27;s bloddy hot outside. While Hawker centers usually don&#x27;t have AC, they at least tend to have fans everywhere, which makes it a bit more tolerable than eating food outside in the street.<p>It <i>is</i> street food in the sense that it&#x27;s all really cheap food that&#x27;s prepared almost instantly, you can eat it in a hurry, and the Hawker centers are all in major thoroughfares.",
