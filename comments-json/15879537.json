  "text" : "In the context of this discussion, which is gold holders hypothetically pumping &amp; dumping the market it&#x27;s pretty much only the big reserve holders that matter.<p>How do you think someone who&#x27;s gold holdings are 1 kg in a warehouse embedded in motherboards is going to extract that to dump it on the market? Most gold by weight is effectively illiquid, while every Bitcoin is equally liquid.<p>As the source the article uses[1] discusses the breakdown of those 187,200 tons is:<p>* Jewellery: 89,200 tonnes, 47.6%<p>* Private investment: 40,000 tonnes, 21.4%<p>* Official sector: 31,500 tonnes, 16.8%<p>* Other: 26,500 tonnes, 14.2%<p>* Below ground stocks: 57,000 tonnes<p>So around 50% of the number you&#x27;re quoting is gold still in the ground. To repeat your snarky remark: Did you read the article?<p>I guess counting the official sector and private investment the top 10 official holders &quot;only&quot; have around 30% of the liquid market, which is way more distorted than Bitcoin, and very comparable in this context of a few owners of large liquid assets being able to distort the market.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gold.org&#x2F;about-gold&#x2F;gold-supply&#x2F;gold-mining&#x2F;how-much-gold-has-been-mined\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gold.org&#x2F;about-gold&#x2F;gold-supply&#x2F;gold-mining&#x2F;how-...</a>",
