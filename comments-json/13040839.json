  "text" : "Have these friends of yours tried talking to e.g. a powerlifting or bodybuilding coach? It&#x27;s pretty easy to get on a structured low-effort diet to gain weight, and muscle mass with some exercise thrown in.<p>Getting above 1500 calories isn&#x27;t some desperate effort of &quot;spend[ing] every waking moment stuffing in high-calorie food&quot;. It&#x27;s a couple of protein shakes a day that take you a couple of minutes to prepare &amp; slurp down.<p>Eating enough <i>can</i> be a very difficult logistical problem, but not at the 1500 calorie level, but at something like a &gt;5000 calorie level where you&#x27;re a professional strongman or powerlifter, or someone like Michael Phelps eating 8000 calories a day.",
