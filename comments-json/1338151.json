Examples include living persons, video game characters, some piece of software you wrote, or anything else that's not very notable, controversial or hard to find references for.<p>However for the vast majority of topics this isn't an issue. If you're just writing about a place, landmark, some historical character, a scientific discipline or any of the topics that make up ~80% of the actual content on Wikipedia you're not going to have your article listed for deletion.",
