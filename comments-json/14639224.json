But the general approach is very transferable.<p>Ask the candidate about some trivial problem solvable in 1 minute with standard tooling they use every day, you&#x27;d be amazed at the architecture astronauts that come out of the woodworks keen to waste their time on some needlessly over-engineered solution.",
