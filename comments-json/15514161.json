  "text" : "Your characterization that the 737 is a 50-year old airframe and wouldn&#x27;t compete with the CS300 is entirely inaccurate.<p>Boeing just keeps the same model numbers for a series of aircraft, but through gradual evolution of sub-models the newest 737 MAX that exists today is an entirely different plane from the original 737-100 released in 1966.<p>Just look at this specification table for the different models on Wikipedia: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Boeing_737#Specifications\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Boeing_737#Specifications</a><p>Pretty much the only thing that&#x27;s the same is that the fuselage is the same diameter. Everything else from length, height, wing span, passenger count &amp; even how fast it cruises has changed over the years. It now has over twice the range that it did in 1966.<p>Secondly just because two aircraft aren&#x27;t exactly the same size doesn&#x27;t mean they aren&#x27;t competing for the same market. As an example no airline sits down and decides they need a plane that carries exactly 150 passengers, and 180 would be out of the question.<p>Instead they look at the overall price, efficiency etc. Maybe they&#x27;ll buy a smaller plane and run more flights per day, rather than a bigger plane with fewer flights.<p>You can trivially see this by looking at the multitude of airframes you can choose to fly with between pretty much any two major international airports.",
