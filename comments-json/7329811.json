I don&#x27;t think it would be appropriate to name-drop the company given the topic, but contact me if you&#x27;re interested.<p>Anyway, given my admittedly somewhat limited knowledge of immigration law I don&#x27;t think what you want to be looking at <i>at all</i> is getting asylum somewhere. That&#x27;s going to be a process that&#x27;s a <i>giant pain in the ass</i> anywhere in the world.<p>There&#x27;s also lots of major caveats with getting asylum, generally to do with you or your ethnic&#x2F;social group being specifically discriminated against or otherwise in danger. You&#x27;re generally not going to get asylum just because you don&#x27;t like the general security situation in your country of residence. If that was the case the first world would pretty much grant blanked asylum to millions to billions of people living in the failed states of the world.<p>If you have a specialist skill such as being a developer a much better and quicker path to emigrating is to get a work visa somewhere, and go from there to potentially getting a permanent residence permit or even citizenship",
