  "text" : "My impression (as a European) of the US system is that in practice what we have with individual states here in Europe + EU isn&#x27;t possible in the US, since the federal government taxes are proportionally so high, compared to what individual EU members contribute to the EU.<p>Thus while individual states <i>could</i> implement their own health care system, it would have to be on top of everything that&#x27;s federally mandated, which they&#x27;re already paying for. The tax burden would be outrageous, so it just doesn&#x27;t happen.<p>It&#x27;s also odd to see other Europeans dismiss the argument many Americans have for a smaller federal government, while in practice that&#x27;s pretty much what we have over here in the EU. Could you imagine a EU-wide single-payer health care system? It would be a complete disaster.<p>So in that sense I wonder if the better solution for the EU would be to roll back all federal health entitlements (Medicare etc.) and just implement this completely on the state levels, then states like California and the like could have European-like single-payer health care systems, while perhaps other states would opt for different systems.",
