  "text" : "Reading over the Wikipedia article[1] it seems that you&#x27;re historically at least somewhat correct, since this tax used to be directly based on the price of the car, but since 2007 it&#x27;s been partially and then in 2010 entirely based on CO^2 emissions.<p>There are other tolls &amp; fees for owning a car in The Netherlands. I don&#x27;t own a car, but from what I&#x27;ve read taken as a whole the tax policy here has nothing to do with &quot;luxury&quot;, you&#x27;re free to buy a million Euro gold-plated scooter.<p>It&#x27;s meant to discourage excessively heavy vehicles and those who pollute more. Any sort of a flat fee that doesn&#x27;t take into account the weight &#x2F; size of the vehicle doesn&#x27;t account for the disproportional cost to infrastructure incurred by larger &amp; more polluting vehicles.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nl.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Belasting_van_personenauto%27s_en_motorrijwielen\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nl.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Belasting_van_personenauto%27s...</a>",
