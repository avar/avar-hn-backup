  "text" : "In The Netherlands you can go with a bank like ABN that issues you a dongle called the e.dentifier. It looks like this: <a href=\"http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/dutch-ideal-paymentsystem-using-e-dentifier-netherlands-offers-merchants-real-time-payment-method-publicized-as-low-cost-34257435.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thumbs.dreamstime.com&#x2F;z&#x2F;dutch-ideal-paymentsystem-usi...</a><p>To make an online transaction with it you insert your debit card into it, enter a random sequence of digits displayed on the bank website as well as your PIN in the dongle to get a sequence of digits that you enter into the dongle again.<p>I found it annoying to have to carry this device everywhere in case I needed to make a bank transaction, so I went with the only bank in The Netherlands that does TAN codes, ING.<p>Every 6-8 months or so I&#x27;ll get a sheet of 100 TAN codes in the snail mail, I&#x27;ll OCR the full sheet with offline-enabled Android app whose name I forget, convert it to a text file, edit it a bit, and encrypt the text file with GPG.<p>Then when I need to make transfers I can ssh to a box or use my laptop to &quot;gpg -d tan.txt.gpg | grep ^123&quot; where 123 is the TAN code number that the online form requests.<p>They recently amended this system so that there&#x27;s a second set of TAN codes (that comes in another snail mail) that they&#x27;ll supposedly ask for if you make a transaction from a suspicious IP address, I&#x27;ve yet to use one of those.<p>It sucks a bit but I find it far better than having to carry some device on my person at all times.",
