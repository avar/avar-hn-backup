If it&#x27;s the latter how does that even work?<p>Are there no optional libraries? No outdated libraries whose version you have to detect? No obscure platforms whose architecture you have to detect for unsafe inline code etc.?<p>Because if you can have any of those or any number of other cases where you need compile-time detection of configuration options you&#x27;re going to need something like autoconf.",
