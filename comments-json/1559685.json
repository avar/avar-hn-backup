  "text" : "&#62; Bill and Melinda Gates have done tremendous good in the world, and anyone who thinks otherwise is either crude or uninformed.<p>Their foundation has done a lot of good, but it doesn't exist in a vacuum. Why does it have all that money in the first place?<p>Well, mostly because Microsoft managed to work itself into a monopoly position with dirty tactics, and the proliferation of their own proprietary file formats. This meant that millions of people and organizations had to pay the Microsoft tax, which was later used to start the B&#38;M Gates Foundation.<p>How many millions of US$ would those people have donated to charity if their budgets hadn't been constrained by purchasing Microsoft software? Some of them were probably African countries that could have used that money to buy vaccines 10 years ago.<p>Don't get me wrong, the Bill &#38; Melinda Gates Foundation is doing some good work <i>now</i>, but to only look at their current donations is to only see the tip of the iceberg.",
