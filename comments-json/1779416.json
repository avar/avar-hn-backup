I don't see why people that know they're going to die in 6 months or 2 years from now should be expected to behave any differently than the rest of us.<p>There's certainly a place for getting your affairs in order, but spending the rest of your days feeling sorry for yourself is a bad waste of time as far as I'm concerned.",
