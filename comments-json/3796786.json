If you reduce cache expiration <i>your</i> query might not benifit, but if you take a holistic approach to it and apply it to the whole database it'll benefit as a whole.<p>Any big MySQL powered application is likely to make wide use of this. Which goes to show that doing any benchmark comparisons between databases is often meaningless. You can't benchmark the same schema/queries between databases because they'll be optimized for the database you started out with.",
