Right now the system is simple, you order a car and for some reason the app turns off, you get charged a cancellation fee. That&#x27;s a hard problem to solve.<p>What if you have one Uber and two customers who&#x27;d like to order it, one with 3% battery and one with 97%? Should the risk of sending the car to the user with 3% battery purely be assumed by Uber?",
