  "text" : "I use Emacs to do all my editing. But I think it's a failure compared to what it could have been.<p>There's nothing inherent about Emacs that ties it to being an editor, it could have been rewritten a long time ago in Scheme or acquired a FFI. Then things like GNOME or TextMate might have been rewritten as part of the Emacs ecosystem, while looking exactly like they do today.<p>Instead Emacs is a very specific thing to a small crowd, and adding things like a FFI to it have been vetoed by Stallman in the past. That's one of the reasons I think that we still don't have Lisp as a first-class systems programming language on GNU as the initial announcement promised: <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/gnu/initial-announcement.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.gnu.org/gnu/initial-announcement.html</a><p>GCC is much the same. There was a proposal many years ago to make a libgcc. Stallman vetoed that on the basis that things like C++ support might be written without contributing the changes back to the FSF.<p>That's a fair point, but LLVM+Clang are quickly replacing GCC in some areas due to its monolithic architecture. You can't write things like a C source code using GCC as a backend (easily), but you can with the LLVM tools.",
