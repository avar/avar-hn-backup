  "text" : "(Disclaimer again: I work for Booking.com in IT)<p><pre><code>    &#62; I would advice against agoda and booking.com as they\n    &#62; forward your credit card info to the hotel as security.\n</code></pre>\nThey don't forward your credit card as security. They forward it for the hotel to charge you for the entirety of your booking.<p>Companies like Expedia follow the merchant model, they buy up hotels rooms in bulk in advance and then re-sell them directly to customers. When you buy from a merchant your credit card isn't shared with the hotel as there's no need to do so.<p>Other companies like Booking.com and Agoda follow the agency model. They find customers for the hotels, forward their payment details along to the hotel, the hotel charges the customer, and then pays the agency a percentage of the booking as an agency fee[1].<p>Both models have their pros and cons. The merchant model works brilliantly in the US where large chains are the norm. It works less well in Europe where the vast number of hotels are small properties.<p><pre><code>    &#62; Imagine the surprise when you are at the hotel counter\n    &#62; and the staff shows you a printout of your credit card\n    &#62; info(nothing obscured; everything in plain text).\n</code></pre>\nIt's fair enough that this makes you uncomfortable. But the hotel with that printout has a contract with the credit card company like any other merchant and is responsible for treating it responsibly.<p>I think you'd also be very surprised at the number of other merchants you might deal with where this is the case. Having a printout with a credit card number is not at all unusual in a lot of businesses.",
