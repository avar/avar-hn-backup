  "text" : "That analogy doesn't hold up. If you learn mechanics you can repair and maintain your car, and even build a new one. But you'll never get your car to drive your kids to school without you sitting behind the wheel.<p>But you can do the equivalent of that if you're programming literate. We're moving to a digital culture, and if you don't know how to program you'll increasingly only become a consumer of other people's solutions, without the ability to solve your own problems.<p>Some people are calling this \"procedural literacy\".<p>As an aside I'd argue that computer interfaces have actually gotten somewhat worse while getting more friendly to newcomers. I think the last major leap in computer interfaces was cron(1). Unlike most modern interfaces being produced today you can use it to tell your computer to produce periodic reports and things like that.<p>That's where we should be headed with UI's, not aiming to have a monkey banging at the terminal at all times, but giving the monkey the ability to dictate things to the computer so he doesn't have to bang at the terminal.<p>Real computing power is being able to say: \"Computer, I'm feeling under the weather today and I think I'll sleep in. At 9am please start playing 'Daddy's sick, get up and go to school!' on a loop in the kid's bedroom at 75 dB, and continue producing noise until they get out the door, engage!\".<p>You can implement those sorts of things if you're a programmer.",
