  "text" : "Perhaps you missed the part where I indicated that they were better than the previous government. They're just still a disappointment.<p>It's not like I'm some bitter right winger either, my views align more closely with theirs in theory. But in practice they're about the worst thing that could have happened after the crisis, sans the incumbents.<p>They've failed to enact any meaningful change to financial regulation or government oversight since they took power. They've failed to implement the government transparency that was widely demanded of them (e.g. doing secretive dealings with the IMF). The issue of changing the constitution is now dead in some committee.<p>As an example of something that's (still) being done right check out the election of the Best Party in Reykjav√≠k. Their agenda (here in Icelandic: <a href=\"http://www.bestiflokkurinn.is/ur-starfi-flokksins/samstarfsyfirlysing-besta-flokksins-og-samfylkingarinnar\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.bestiflokkurinn.is/ur-starfi-flokksins/samstarfsy...</a>) includes things that are actually relevant to improving short- and long term life for the population. They've set up an instance of a \"shadow government\" at <a href=\"http://betrireykjavik.is\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://betrireykjavik.is</a> (running <a href=\"http://github.com/rbjarnason/open-direct-democracy\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://github.com/rbjarnason/open-direct-democracy</a>), a fair amount of their policies \nare being drawn from there. So they're actually listening to their constituency.",
