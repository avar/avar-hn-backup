I was mainly responding to your hyperbolic statement that the disabled could go to &quot;a restaurant&quot;.<p>You&#x27;ll find that the disabled have plenty of options, it&#x27;s definitely not the case that if you don&#x27;t say enforce wheelchair accessibility for seating areas that there are no restaurants around to accommodate the disabled.<p>But you do get a lot of hole in the wall places of a type I simply haven&#x27;t seen in the US, e.g. what would be a very small take-away restaurant in the US, but with a ceiling high enough to have an upstairs floor accessible through some very steep set of stairs to get to a seating area.<p>That&#x27;s what I mean by society being poorer for it. It&#x27;s not a choice between waiving a magic wand to make everything wonderful for the disabled or not. Complying with what amounts to onerous building codes can cost a lot, and often that cost is so high that the establishment isn&#x27;t viable anymore.",
