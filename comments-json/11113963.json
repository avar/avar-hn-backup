  "text" : "Isn&#x27;t it interesting that despite a lot of Sander&#x27;s voters being against the outcome of Citizens United that his very presence as a viable candidate at this point is in a way a demonstration of the point the Supreme Court made in their majority opinion?<p>I.e. here we have a guy who&#x27;s not taking donations from big corporations, but is just as visible as Hillary who is. Money&#x27;s speech apparently, and either lots from a few big donors or small amounts from lots of small donors counts.<p>Regardless of what happens with this election I think what&#x27;s happening so far is indicative of a major change. If things keep going in this direction the 2024 election is going to be very interesting indeed.",
