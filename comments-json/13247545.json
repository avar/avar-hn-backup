With odds like that you&#x27;ll still get people to sign up as astronauts, and it&#x27;ll be easier to advance the science. In the grand scheme of things it&#x27;s silly to worry about those deaths and not say death from traffic accidents.<p>The real issue was that that&#x27;s not how NASA presented it outwardly. I doubt that teacher that blew up with Challenger was told about her odds of surviving in those terms.<p>As human launch vehicles go I think the shuttle&#x27;s reliability was fine. The reason I called it a death machine is that if you make a vehicle that explodes 1% of the time you better advertise that pretty thoroughly before people step on board. NASA didn&#x27;t.",
