  "text" : "How is Leah Rowe (the Libreboot maintainer) in a position to know better than the FSF why the FSF fired someone?<p>Is she directly involved? Does&#x2F;did she also work for the FSF with the people in question, or does she just have some relationship with the person who got fired and is getting their side of the story?<p>She&#x27;s now publicly calling for the firing of several people of the FSF &amp; the destruction of their livelihoods and careers.<p>I have <i>no</i> involvement in any of this, but as someone on the sidelines who&#x27;s been reading about it here on HN this just seems like he said she said hearsay resulting in the tech equivalent of tabloid dramas &amp; trials in the court of public opinion.",
