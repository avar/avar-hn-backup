  "text" : "Well of course population growth isn&#x27;t the same as demand, that&#x27;s the point!<p>What davidw was observing was that there&#x27;s plenty of cities that do better at satisfying the demand for housing than San Francisco does.<p>You can have a growing population in the same area while demand goes down, if you&#x27;re building enough new housing to offset the demand. The examples davidw and I have been citing here show cities that have faced similar population growth that have built up rather than succumbing to SF&#x27;s housing problems.<p>I think your claim that it&#x27;s apples to oranges is invalid. Yes SF has been a boomtown, but plenty of cities all over the world have been boomtowns without the same issues.<p>The issue is that SF has been a boomtown <i>AND</i> hasn&#x27;t gotten its act together when it comes to building up density. That&#x27;s what makes it a special case, and that&#x27;s why both the demand for housing housing prices are ridiculous there.",
