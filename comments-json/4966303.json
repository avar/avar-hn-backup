You get something you wouldn't get when booking directly through the hotel.<p>When you use an OTA you have collective bargaining power; If the hotel screws you around in any way it's now the OTA's problem. They'll call up the hotel on your behalf (in their native language, which you may or may not speak) and either sort it out with them or make sure you have somewhere else to stay because you're now <i>their</i> customer.<p>Of course the service you get differs a lot by OTA. But from the customer's perspective there's usually a net gain by booking through one.",
