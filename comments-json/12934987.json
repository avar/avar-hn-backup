How long do you think it&#x27;s tenable for the US to maintain its current commitments? When it&#x27;s down to 20% of world GDP? 10%, 5%?<p>The US is still coasting on foreign policy that was essentially made in 1945 after WWII. There&#x27;s just no way that policy can be maintained indefinitely.<p>Trump has made comments to the effect that he&#x27;d like to lay the foundations of a new type of foreign policy that&#x27;ll last for decades to come. Whatever you think of his plans I think it&#x27;s clear that the US can&#x27;t maintain these foreign entanglements indefinitely, and will need to distribute some of the load to their current allies.",
