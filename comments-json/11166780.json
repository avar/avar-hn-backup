Essentially some believe that there&#x27;s some secret\nsauce in the brain that gives rise to consciousness, while others\nbelieve that there&#x27;s no such &quot;hard&quot; problem and that &quot;consciousness&quot;\nis just what we call a bunch of simpler brain systems working in\nunison.<p>My opinion is a layman that&#x27;s read quite a bit about this is that\nthere&#x27;s no &quot;hard&quot; problem, and the only thing that separates us from\n&quot;lower&quot; animals is just that we&#x27;re running a slightly more\nsophisticated version of the same physical brain processes, which we\nlike to call consciousness.<p>There&#x27;s no reason to believe that we&#x27;re anything than the cumulative\nbehavior of our brain matter, or that we&#x27;re somehow &quot;special&quot; in the\nanimal kingdom in another sense than e.g. wolves are more special &amp;\nsophisticated than mice.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hard_problem_of_consciousness\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hard_problem_of_consciousness</a>",
