Someone comes up with a working implementation, proves it to work &#38; to be better than the existing stuff, and then they propose it for inclusion.<p>That's what Google is doing, and they're using Google Chrome as their test bed (along presumably, with a bunch of non-Chrome stuff internally).<p>This is the same thing they did with SPDY. See <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPDY#Relation_to_HTTP\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPDY#Relation_to_HTTP</a> for details.<p>If what you're hinting at is that they should first start some wider discussion about what a next-gen UDP should look like before they start doing anything, then I suggest you look up \"bikeshedding\". Such a process would never get anywhere.",
