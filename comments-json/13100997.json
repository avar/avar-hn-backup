Just like 1MB of JS takes about a second to download &amp; render on your current &gt;1MB&#x2F;s connection.<p>Back in the day people used to complain about these huge background images just as much as purists today complain about &gt;1MB JS&#x2F;CSS assets, which given Moore&#x27;s law &amp; the increase in network speeds works out to be the same thing, relatively speaking.<p>1. <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mars.nasa.gov&#x2F;MPF&#x2F;gif&#x2F;rca.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mars.nasa.gov&#x2F;MPF&#x2F;gif&#x2F;rca.gif</a> -&gt; 56K =~ 55854 bytes",
