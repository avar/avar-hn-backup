  "text" : "That's an excellent book. I have a paper copy of it. While the article\nis right about cellphone chargers things like this lack some context:<p><pre><code>    Glass requires so much energy to make - or recycle - that it is\n    always more eco-friendly to use aluminium cans\n</code></pre>\nFirstly, that depends on <i>how</i> you recycle things. Perhaps in the UK\nthey melt down their glass and make it anew, but in some other\ncountries such as Denmark they'll actually use the <i>same</i> bottle again\nafter cleaning it out.<p>If you buy a soft drink in a class bottle in Denmark you'll get a\ncontainer that looks like it's seen war.<p>Secondly, it's presuming that pounds sterling is the best way to\nmeasure sustainability, and that just because something costs more now\nit's less sustainable in the long run.<p>Which is just patently silly. We basically have infinite energy on\nthis planet as long as the sun keeps shining, but we don't have\ninfinite easily accessible aluminum.<p>In the future access to basic material resources is going to be a\n<i>lot</i> more important than whether someone expended a few extra joules\nback in 2010.",
