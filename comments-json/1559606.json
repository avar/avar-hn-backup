Almost all software is the equivalent of toilet paper, it's something auxiliary that should perform a service so that you can get on with your life.<p>Just because people demand a different color toilet paper (free software) the demand doesn't go away.<p>If everyone demanded that software be free we'd still have cellphones, search engines and games because people <i>want that stuff</i>, and they're going to pay for it one way or the other.<p>Of course business models would be different, but the end result probably wouldn't be. The main difference would be that there'd be more collaboration on shared problems (like game engines), instead of each proprietary software company coming up with their own solution.",
