Most of the parts for the space vehicles are already made by subcontractors, aren't they just changing how the oversight is done?<p>Even with those rules changed NASA is still going to be responsible for the astronauts. It'll take years and billions of dollars to man-rate  vehicles that we wouldn't have thought twice about using back in the 70s as long as they didn't explode on the first couple of test flights.<p>Maybe money flowing out of the Space Shuttle program will get us there sooner, but with the US rebooting its space program every time time a new president takes office I'm starting to think the Chinese are our best hope for getting to the stars.",
