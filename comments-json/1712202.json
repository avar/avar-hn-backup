  "text" : "In the Git project we target Perl 5.6 for critical code (like git add --interactive) and Perl 5.8 for some other code (like git-svn). Those are 10 and 8 years out of date, respectively. Or the equivalent of targeting Python 1.6 and 2.0.<p>It can be mildly annoying sometimes to have to use 5.6 features when I usually develop on 5.12 or newer, but Perl's policy of backwards compatibility makes this a <i>lot</i> easier than it would be in Python.<p>Git also has some Python code that targets 2.4, making it compatible with such an old version was relatively easy (see <a href=\"http://git.kernel.org/?p=git/git.git;a=commit;h=23b093ee087e9\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://git.kernel.org/?p=git/git.git;a=commit;h=23b093ee087e...</a> for an example). A <i>lot</i> easier anyway than rewriting and maintaining that code in C.",
