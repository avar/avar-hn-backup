The Data Protection Directive wouldn't help if you Europe were to fall under Nazi control again.<p>It's just a law that says the government can't process the data in certain ways, they still <i>have</i> the data though, and could start mining it by changing the law, or ignoring it.<p>If they actually cared they wouldn't be gathering this data in the first place. The U.S. (officially) keeps a lot less data on its citizens than the average European country, but that's been changing in the recent decades since the FBI, NSA and others were founded.",
