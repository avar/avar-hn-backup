  "text" : "That&#x27;s a trivial cost when we&#x27;re talking about sending things to Mars. The Curiosity rover has around 5kg of Pu-238. NASA estimates that restarting production will cost $6M&#x2F;kg[1]. The total cost of the MSL program is 2.5 billion[2]. That&#x27;s $30 million out of 2.5 billion, or 1.2%.<p>NASA has also been buying Pu-238 from the Russians at around $1.5 million&#x2F;kg[3], which would be $7.5 million for Curiosity, or 0.3% of the cost of the program.<p>I&#x27;m interested in deep-space exploration (but am no expert), and as far as I can tell the reason the US is running out of Pu-238 has absolutely nothing to do with cost.<p>It&#x27;s been happening because only NASA has really wanted this, but producing it has been the purview of the military or the DOE.<p>So the issue has been stuck in some bureaucratic nightmare for decades, the only people allowed to produce Pu-238 didn&#x27;t need it, and NASA couldn&#x27;t simply spend a crapload of money to pay another agency or branch of the government to restart production due to the way money politics works, even though it was an overall good investment.<p>So rather than simply restart production at a trivial cost compared to what NASA otherwise spends, it&#x27;s been easier to buy it from Russia.<p>As [1] shows there&#x27;s now a real possibility that Pu-238 will run out, so the US has restarted production.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nasa.gov&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;636900main_Howe_Presentation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nasa.gov&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;636900main_Howe_Presentation.pdf</a><p>2. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mars_Science_Laboratory\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mars_Science_Laboratory</a><p>3. <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dailycaller.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;03&#x2F;28&#x2F;nasa-wants-to-stop-buying-russian-plutonium&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dailycaller.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;03&#x2F;28&#x2F;nasa-wants-to-stop-buying-...</a>",
