The film is rated PG-13, not the concept of Avatar or the merchandise.<p>And given the comments about True Lies any subversion of the rating system sounds like a great thing. Obviously otherwise excellent movies are being made into mediocre crap so that they can reach a wider audience and rake in more money.",
