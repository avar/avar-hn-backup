  "text" : "I'm just a mortal developer so I don't have to admin anything serious, but here's how I do backups of my personal files &#38; server. Mainly using Git:<p>Any code / changes to Debian's default /etc setup go into Git and are at least on both the relevant machine (laptop or server) and GitHub. See <a href=\"http://github.com/avar\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://github.com/avar</a> and <a href=\"http://github.com/avar/linode-etc\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://github.com/avar/linode-etc</a> for the /etc on the server. I keep some personal data (like finance notes) in GPG encrypted files in private Git repositories.<p>E-Mail is backed up my Google's GMail (presumably) and data like my small collection of music is something I can always get back from the Internet.<p>If the filesystem on my laptop, server or GitHub is destroyed right now I can get everything working again relatively quickly just by installing Ubuntu or Debian from scratch and copying my home directory, /etc and code from Git on one of the remaining machines.<p>I've made a script that automatically backs up my Git repositories daily (<a href=\"http://github.com/avar/github-backup\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://github.com/avar/github-backup</a>), the resulting backup is around 180MB. Losing some of my other data would be an annoyance but this is all I /really/ care about.<p>Follow somebody else's advice if you need \"real\" backups, but for my simple needs this suffices.",
