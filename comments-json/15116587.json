My primary beef is with the lazy way the article is written. Maybe this trial is unethical, maybe it isn&#x27;t.<p>But the argument put forward in the article would equally apply if this research were done in the EU. I.e. that it&#x27;s somehow inherently bad that US regulatory agencies aren&#x27;t involved in medical research that happens abroad.<p><pre><code>    &gt; they deliberately chose to evade strong oversight.\n</code></pre>\nMaybe they did. Companies selectively choose legal jurisdictions based on regulations all the time. E.g. EU food regulation is stricter than US regulation. Would you say that it&#x27;s unethical for a EU company to fund food startups in the US for that reason?<p>The article quotes Thiel as saying &quot;you would not be able to invent the polio vaccine [in the US] today&quot;. I don&#x27;t know if that claim is true, but if it is (or even if today the vaccine&#x27;s introduction to the market were delayed compared to the 1950s) this whole question of &quot;unethical&quot; trials v.s. overly strict regulations becomes much more complex.",
