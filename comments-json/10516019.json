Similarly it&#x27;s not the smallest Linux distro by far.<p>I think this whole line of argument is just some misplaced nostalgia for distro micro-optimization. It&#x27;s not the mid-90s anymore. Space and CPU is cheap, you&#x27;re not going to gain anything significant by trimming down your distro.<p>If those things were actually important you wouldn&#x27;t be using Azure in the first place.",
